## H&R REIT - May 2020 Cut (50% reduction)

**Cut Details:**
- **Date:** May 2020
- **Previous Distribution:** $0.115/month ($1.38 annual)
- **New Distribution:** $0.0575/month ($0.69 annual)
- **Cut Magnitude:** 50.0%

**Pre-Cut Metrics (Q1-Q2 2020):**

### AFFO Metrics
- **H1 2020 AFFO per unit:** $0.69 (6 months combined)
- **Estimated Q1 2020 AFFO:** ~$0.35 per unit
- **Q1 2020 estimated payout ratio:** ~99% (near 100%)
  - Calculation: ($0.115 × 3 months) / $0.35 = $0.345 / $0.35 ≈ 99%
- **H1 2020 FFO payout ratio:** 69% (after May cut took effect)

### Leverage Metrics (as of June 30, 2020)
- **Debt/Total Assets:** 48.1% (increased from 44.4% at Dec 2019)
- **Weighted Average Interest Rate:** 3.5%
- **Average Debt Maturity:** 3.9 years
- **Debt Maturities in 2020:** $99.2M remaining

### Interest Coverage
- **Not explicitly disclosed** in Q2 2020 release
- Need to calculate: NOI / Interest Expense
- **Context:** Fair value writedowns of $1.3B on properties

### Liquidity Position (June 30, 2020)
- **Cash on Hand:** $131.4M
- **Unused Borrowing Capacity:** $995.8M
- **New Credit Facility:** $500M unsecured line (secured Q2 2020)
- **Total Available Liquidity:** ~$1.127B

### Cash Runway Estimate
- Monthly burn rate (if needed): Distribution $0.115 × 3 = $0.345M/month (assuming per-unit basis)
- With $131.4M cash: ~380 months (not burning - had positive AFFO)
- **Status:** Not applicable - positive AFFO, strong liquidity

### Self-Funding Assessment
- **AFFO:** Positive ($0.69 per 6mo)
- **Distributions:** Covered by AFFO at 69% post-cut
- **Pre-cut sustainability:** ~99% payout = marginally sustainable
- **Conclusion:** Distribution cut was proactive response to pandemic uncertainty, not imminent crisis

### Management Commentary
- "Additional financial flexibility to absorb any income interruption related to the pandemic"
- New rate "expected to satisfy the REIT's requirement to distribute all of its taxable income"
- Board committed to quarterly reevaluation

- AFFO payout ratio >111% for 9 months was clearly unsustainable
- Interest coverage declining (3.23x → 3.14x)
- AFFO per unit declining Y/Y
- "More conservative payout ratio" to restore sustainability

## Pattern Analysis

### Universal Warning Signal: AFFO Payout Ratio >95%

**All three cuts had payout ratios ≥99%:**
- H&R: ~99%
- RioCan: ~100%
- Artis: 112.5% (most severe)

**Implication:** AFFO payout approaching or exceeding 100% is a critical threshold

### Debt/Assets Similarity

**All three REITs:** Debt/Assets ~48-50%
- H&R: 48.1%
- RioCan: ~45-50% (estimated)
- Artis: 48.6%

**Implication:** Leverage alone did not trigger cuts (all within normal REIT range of 45-55%)

### Interest Coverage Patterns

**Artis:** 3.14x (disclosed, declining trend)
**H&R/RioCan:** Not disclosed (likely >2.0x for investment grade)

**Implication:** Interest coverage <3.5x combined with high payout ratio = elevated risk

### External Shocks

**H&R & RioCan:** COVID-19 pandemic (2020)
**Artis:** Calgary office market weakness, oil crisis aftermath (2018)

**Implication:** Sector/macro stress + high payout = cut catalyst
