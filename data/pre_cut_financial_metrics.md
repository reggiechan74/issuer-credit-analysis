## H&R REIT - May 2020 Cut (50% reduction)

**Cut Details:**
- **Date:** May 2020
- **Previous Distribution:** $0.115/month ($1.38 annual)
- **New Distribution:** $0.0575/month ($0.69 annual)
- **Cut Magnitude:** 50.0%

**Pre-Cut Metrics (Q1-Q2 2020):**

### AFFO Metrics
- **H1 2020 AFFO per unit:** $0.69 (6 months combined)
- **Estimated Q1 2020 AFFO:** ~$0.35 per unit
- **Q1 2020 estimated payout ratio:** ~99% (near 100%)
  - Calculation: ($0.115 × 3 months) / $0.35 = $0.345 / $0.35 ≈ 99%
- **H1 2020 FFO payout ratio:** 69% (after May cut took effect)

### Leverage Metrics (as of June 30, 2020)
- **Debt/Total Assets:** 48.1% (increased from 44.4% at Dec 2019)
- **Weighted Average Interest Rate:** 3.5%
- **Average Debt Maturity:** 3.9 years
- **Debt Maturities in 2020:** $99.2M remaining

### Interest Coverage
- **Not explicitly disclosed** in Q2 2020 release
- Need to calculate: NOI / Interest Expense
- **Context:** Fair value writedowns of $1.3B on properties

### Liquidity Position (June 30, 2020)
- **Cash on Hand:** $131.4M
- **Unused Borrowing Capacity:** $995.8M
- **New Credit Facility:** $500M unsecured line (secured Q2 2020)
- **Total Available Liquidity:** ~$1.127B

### Cash Runway Estimate
- Monthly burn rate (if needed): Distribution $0.115 × 3 = $0.345M/month (assuming per-unit basis)
- With $131.4M cash: ~380 months (not burning - had positive AFFO)
- **Status:** Not applicable - positive AFFO, strong liquidity

### Self-Funding Assessment
- **AFFO:** Positive ($0.69 per 6mo)
- **Distributions:** Covered by AFFO at 69% post-cut
- **Pre-cut sustainability:** ~99% payout = marginally sustainable
- **Conclusion:** Distribution cut was proactive response to pandemic uncertainty, not imminent crisis

### Management Commentary
- "Additional financial flexibility to absorb any income interruption related to the pandemic"
- New rate "expected to satisfy the REIT's requirement to distribute all of its taxable income"
- Board committed to quarterly reevaluation

- **FFO Growth:** 17.2% Q/Q increase of $0.06 per unit
- **Quarterly Distribution:** $0.12 × 3 = $0.36/quarter

- Reference to MD&A for detailed metrics
- **Annual cash flow benefit from cut:** $152M
- Planned use: Mixed-use residential, unit buybacks, debt repayment

### Management Rationale
- "Ongoing uncertainty as a result of the pandemic"
- "A more conservative payout ratio is important in this undeniably challenging environment"
- **Strategic:** Reallocating $152M to growth and deleveraging

### Estimated Metrics (from external sources)
- **Debt/Assets:** Likely 45-50% range (typical for major REITs)

## Artis REIT - November 2018 Cut (50% reduction)

**Cut Details:**
- **Date:** November 2018
- **Previous Distribution:** $0.27/quarter ($1.08 annual)

- **9-month 2018 AFFO per unit:** $0.67
- **9-month 2017 AFFO per unit:** $0.79 (decline of 15.2% Y/Y)

### Payout Ratios (Pre-Cut) ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Q3 2018 AFFO Payout Ratio:** 112.5% (UNSUSTAINABLE)
  - Calculation: $0.27 distribution / $0.24 AFFO = 112.5%
- **9-month 2018 AFFO Payout Ratio:** 111.0% (normalized basis)
- **Status:** Distributions EXCEEDING cash flow generation

### Leverage Metrics (September 30, 2018)
- **Debt to GBV (Gross Book Value):** 48.6% (vs 49.3% at Dec 31, 2017)
- **Debt to EBITDA:** 8.4x (unchanged from Dec 31, 2017)
- **Interest Coverage (EBITDA/Interest):** 3.14x (vs 3.23x at Sept 30, 2017)

### NAV Metrics
- **NAV per unit:** $15.11 (September 30, 2018)
- **NAV per unit:** $14.86 (December 31, 2017)
- **Change:** +1.7% improvement

### FFO Metrics
- **Q3 2018 FFO per unit:** $0.33

- **Target Payout Ratio:** ~53% of 2019 consensus AFFO
- **Improvement:** 112.5% → 53% payout ratio (substantial deleveraging)

### Management Rationale
- AFFO payout ratio >111% for 9 months was clearly unsustainable
- Interest coverage declining (3.23x → 3.14x)
- AFFO per unit declining Y/Y
- "More conservative payout ratio" to restore sustainability

## Summary Comparison Table

| REIT | Cut Date | Pre-Cut AFFO Payout | Debt/Assets | Interest Cov | Liquidity | Key Warning Sign |
|------|----------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **H&R** | May 2020 | ~99% | 48.1% | Not disclosed | $1.127B | Payout near 100%, pandemic stress |
| **RioCan** | Dec 2020 | ~100% | ~45-50%* | >2.0x* | Strong* | Payout at 100%, pandemic uncertainty |
| **Artis** | Nov 2018 | 112.5% | 48.6% | 3.14x | Not disclosed | **Payout >100% (unsustainable)** |

*Estimated based on industry norms and qualitative disclosures

---

## Pattern Analysis

### Universal Warning Signal: AFFO Payout Ratio >95%

**All three cuts had payout ratios ≥99%:**
- H&R: ~99%
- RioCan: ~100%
- Artis: 112.5% (most severe)

**Implication:** AFFO payout approaching or exceeding 100% is a critical threshold

### Debt/Assets Similarity

**All three REITs:** Debt/Assets ~48-50%
- H&R: 48.1%
- RioCan: ~45-50% (estimated)
- Artis: 48.6%

**Implication:** Leverage alone did not trigger cuts (all within normal REIT range of 45-55%)

### Interest Coverage Patterns

**Artis:** 3.14x (disclosed, declining trend)
**H&R/RioCan:** Not disclosed (likely >2.0x for investment grade)

**Implication:** Interest coverage <3.5x combined with high payout ratio = elevated risk

### External Shocks

**H&R & RioCan:** COVID-19 pandemic (2020)
**Artis:** Calgary office market weakness, oil crisis aftermath (2018)

**Implication:** Sector/macro stress + high payout = cut catalyst

## True North Commercial REIT - November 2023 Suspension (100%, 2nd cut)

**Cut Details:**
- **Date:** November 14, 2023
- **Previous Distribution:** $0.02475/month ($0.297 annual) - already 50% reduced
- **New Distribution:** $0.00 (complete suspension)
- **Cut Magnitude:** 100.0%
- **Context:** Second cut in same year

**Pre-Cut Metrics (Q3 2023):**

### AFFO Metrics - Post First Cut
- **Q3 2023 AFFO per unit:** $0.11
- **Q3 2023 AFFO total:** $10.1M
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 69% (post-50% cut, seemingly sustainable)
- **AFFO Decline Q4 2022 → Q3 2023:** -21.4% ($0.14 → $0.11)
- **FFO per unit:** $0.11
- **FFO total:** $10.4M
- **Status:** Despite 69% payout, operations continued deteriorating

### Leverage Metrics (September 30, 2023)
- **Debt to GBV:** 61.4% (increased from 59.3% in Q4 2022)
- **Weighted Average Interest Rate:** 4.03% (up 49 bps from 3.54%)
- **Weighted Average Debt Term:** 2.99 years
- **New Mortgage Rate (Q3 2023):** 6.05% (vs 4.03% portfolio avg)
- **Status:** Leverage increasing, refinancing at significantly higher rates

### Interest Coverage - DETERIORATING
- **Interest Coverage:** 2.43x (declined from 3.00x in Q4 2022)
- **Decline:** -19.0% quarter-over-quarter
- **Status:** Approaching distressed levels (<2.5x threshold)

### Liquidity Position (September 30, 2023)
- **Available Liquidity:** $48.3M
- **Credit Facility Total:** $60M
- **Credit Facility Drawn:** $18.1M
- **Credit Facility Available:** $41.9M
- **YTD Refinancing:** $67.6M at 5.65% average rate
- **Status:** Adequate but declining from Q4 2022 ($63.1M)

### Operational Metrics - WEAK
- **Portfolio Occupancy:** 93% (flat vs Q4 2022, but down from 97% pre-pandemic)
- **NOI (Quarterly):** $18.1M (down from $20.6M in Q4 2022)
- **NOI (YTD):** $55.2M
- **NOI Decline YoY:** -18%
- **Revenue (Quarterly):** $32.8M
- **Revenue (YTD):** $99.3M
- **Revenue Decline YoY:** -11%
- **NAV per Unit:** $4.97
- **Unit Price:** $1.22 (75% discount to NAV)
- **Major Lease Expiries:** 216K SF in Q1-Q2 2023 not backfilled

### Why First Cut Failed
1. **Continued AFFO Decline:** -21% despite distribution cut
2. **Interest Coverage Compression:** 3.00x → 2.43x (approaching distress)
3. **Rising Refinancing Costs:** 6.05% new debt vs 4.03% avg (50% increase)
4. **Revenue/NOI Deterioration:** -11% revenue, -18% NOI year-over-year
5. **Structural Office Weakness:** Remote work impact, occupancy 93% vs 97% pre-pandemic
6. **Major Lease Rollovers:** 216K SF expired without replacement

### Management Rationale
- "Reallocate substantially all distributions to purchase Units under NCIB"
- Units trading at $1.22 vs NAV $4.97 (75% discount) = buybacks "more accretive"
- 5.75:1 unit consolidation announced to address "penny stock" perception
- Suspension "approximately 6 months or earlier if appropriate"
- **Reality:** Distribution cut alone couldn't address operational deterioration

### Market Reaction
- **Day of Announcement:** -15%
- **Full Year 2023:** -80%

## Key Model Insights from All 6 Cuts

### 1. AFFO Payout >95% = Critical Threshold (Confirmed)
All initial cuts: H&R 99%, RioCan 100%, Artis 112.5%, True North 110-127%

### 2. Post-Cut Sustainability ≠ Guaranteed
True North case proves 69% payout INSUFFICIENT if operations deteriorating:
- AFFO declined -21% despite first cut
- Interest coverage fell to 2.43x
- Required 100% suspension 8 months later

### 3. Interest Coverage <2.5x = Distressed Territory
- Artis: 3.14x → CUT
- RioCan: 2.5x → CUT  
- True North: 3.00x → CUT → 2.43x → SUSPENSION

### 4. Debt/EBITDA >8x = Extreme Leverage
- True North: 9.96x (vs normal Debt/Assets 59%)
- Artis: 8.4x

### 5. Covenant Breaches = Immediate Risk
- Slate Office: LTV 65.6% vs 65% limit → immediate suspension

### 6. Office Sector = Structural Weakness
5 of 6 cuts were office REITs (83%)
