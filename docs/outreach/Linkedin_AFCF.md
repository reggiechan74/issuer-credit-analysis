  Enhancing REIT Credit Analysis: Introducing Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF)

  Traditional REIT metrics like FFO and AFFO measure earnings, while ACFO captures operating cash flow. But what about cash available after ALL
  investments—growth capex, acquisitions, and dispositions?

  I've developed and implemented AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow)—a new metric that bridges the gap between operating and financing activities,
  providing a more conservative measure of debt service coverage and distribution sustainability.

  ✅ **Now Production-Ready** (v1.0.6+):
  ✓ Starts with REALPAC ACFO methodology
  ✓ Incorporates net investing cash flows
  ✓ Measures true self-funding capacity
  ✓ Identifies reliance on external financing
  ✓ Automated calculation in credit analysis pipeline
  ✓ Integrated with burn rate and cash runway analysis

  Option 2: Problem-Focused (✅ UPDATED - Implemented v1.0.6)

  Can your REIT really afford its distributions?

  Most analysts use AFFO payout ratios, but AFFO doesn't account for property acquisitions, development projects, or portfolio churn. A REIT can show
   healthy AFFO coverage while still requiring constant capital market access just to maintain operations.

  I've developed and implemented AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow)—a new metric that measures cash available for debt service and distributions AFTER
  all investing activities. It's a more conservative, credit-focused approach that complements existing REIT metrics.

  ✅ **Production Implementation Includes:**
  • Complete methodology aligned with REALPAC standards
  • Automated coverage ratio calculations
  • Self-funding capacity assessment
  • Burn rate and cash runway integration
  • Python implementation in credit analysis pipeline
  • Real-world examples (Dream Industrial REIT, Artis REIT)

  Option 3: Story-Driven (✅ UPDATED - Implemented v1.0.6)

  There was a missing metric in REIT credit analysis.

  Working on credit analysis for real estate issuers, I kept hitting the same question: How much free cash flow is actually available after growth
  investments?

  ACFO tells us about operating cash flow. FFO/AFFO tell us about earnings. But neither captures the full picture when a REIT is actively acquiring
  properties, developing projects, and recycling capital.

  So I researched, designed, and implemented AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow)—a new metric that:
  → Builds on REALPAC's ACFO framework
  → Adds investing activities (acquisitions, dispositions, development)
  → Measures true capacity to service debt + distributions
  → Reveals reliance on capital markets

  ✅ **Now Production-Ready:**
  The metric is fully automated in my credit analysis pipeline (v1.0.12), analyzing real issuers like Dream Industrial REIT and Artis REIT.

  Example: Dream Industrial shows healthy AFFO coverage (86%), but AFCF analysis reveals -$73M free cash flow requiring external financing.
  This hidden capital market dependency wouldn't show up in traditional metrics.

  Option 4: Short & Direct (✅ UPDATED - Implemented v1.0.6)

  ✅ Production-Ready: Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) for REIT Credit Analysis

  I've developed and deployed a new framework that measures cash available for debt service and distributions AFTER all investing activities—filling
  the gap between ACFO (operating cash flow) and traditional FCF.

  Built on REALPAC methodology. Fully automated in Python. Production-tested on real issuers (Dream Industrial, Artis REIT).
