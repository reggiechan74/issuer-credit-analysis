  Enhancing REIT Credit Analysis: Introducing Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF)

  Traditional REIT metrics like FFO and AFFO measure earnings, while ACFO captures operating cash flow. But what about cash available after ALL
  investments—growth capex, acquisitions, and dispositions?

  I've developed a new framework for AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow) that bridges the gap between operating and financing activities, providing a more
   conservative measure of debt service coverage and distribution sustainability.

  Key features:
  ✓ Starts with REALPAC ACFO methodology
  ✓ Incorporates net investing cash flows
  ✓ Measures true self-funding capacity
  ✓ Identifies reliance on external financing

  Option 2: Problem-Focused

  Can your REIT really afford its distributions?

  Most analysts use AFFO payout ratios, but AFFO doesn't account for property acquisitions, development projects, or portfolio churn. A REIT can show
   healthy AFFO coverage while still requiring constant capital market access just to maintain operations.

  I've developed a new metric—Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF)—that measures cash available for debt service and distributions AFTER all investing
  activities. It's a more conservative, credit-focused approach that complements existing REIT metrics.

  The framework includes:
  • Complete methodology aligned with REALPAC standards
  • Coverage ratio calculations
  • Implementation guide with Python functions
  • Real-world examples

  Option 3: Story-Driven

  There's a missing metric in REIT credit analysis.

  Working on credit analysis for real estate issuers, I kept hitting the same question: How much free cash flow is actually available after growth
  investments?

  ACFO tells us about operating cash flow. FFO/AFFO tell us about earnings. But neither captures the full picture when a REIT is actively acquiring
  properties, developing projects, and recycling capital.

  So I researched and designed AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow)—a new metric that:
  → Builds on REALPAC's ACFO framework
  → Adds investing activities (acquisitions, dispositions, development)
  → Measures true capacity to service debt + distributions
  → Reveals reliance on capital markets

  It's particularly useful for analyzing highly levered issuers or growth-oriented REITs.

  Option 4: Short & Direct

  New metric for REIT credit analysis: Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF)

  I've developed a framework that measures cash available for debt service and distributions AFTER all investing activities—filling the gap between
  ACFO (operating cash flow) and traditional FCF.

  Built on REALPAC methodology with complete implementation guide, coverage ratios, and worked examples.
