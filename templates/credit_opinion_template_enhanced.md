## Methodology and Limitations

### Rating Methodology

This credit analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies:

1. **Scale (5%):** Based on gross asset size
2. **Business Profile (25%):** Asset quality and market position
3. **Access to Capital (20%):** Capital markets access and refinancing capability
4. **Leverage & Coverage (35%):** Debt ratios and interest coverage
5. **Financial Policy (15%):** Distribution policy and growth strategy

### Data Sources

- **Phase 3 Calculated Metrics:** Quantitative financial data (strong evidence)
- **Phase 4 Credit Analysis:** Qualitative assessment (moderate evidence)
- **Rating Methodology Standards:** Industry frameworks (strong evidence)

### Evidence Quality

- **Strong Evidence:** Quantitative metrics from financial statements
- **Moderate Evidence:** Qualitative assessments and scorecard application
- **Limited Evidence:** Business profile, access to capital (requires additional research)

### Key Limitations

1. **Single Point-in-Time Analysis:** Based on {{REPORT_PERIOD}} data only
2. **Limited Historical Data:** Trend analysis requires multi-period data
3. **No Management Guidance:** Forward-looking assumptions not validated by management
4. **Incomplete Debt Schedule:** Maturity profile and covenant details not reviewed
5. **No Market Comparables:** Peer analysis not performed
6. **Limited ESG Data:** Property-level environmental and social metrics not available
7. **Forward-Looking Uncertainty:** Scenario analysis based on assumptions that may not materialize

### Professional Caveats

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:**

- This is credit analysis, **NOT investment advice**
- Final rating decisions require credit committee review and approval
- Analysis based on data from a single reporting period
- Forward-looking statements involve uncertainty and assumptions
- Professional review by qualified credit analysts recommended before any credit decision
- This analysis should not be relied upon as the sole basis for credit decisions
- Additional due diligence required for investment-grade rating confirmation

## Appendix B: Moody's-Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```
