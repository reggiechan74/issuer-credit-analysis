## Methodology and Limitations

### Rating Methodology

This credit analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies:

1. **Scale (5%):** Based on gross asset size
2. **Business Profile (25%):** Asset quality and market position
3. **Access to Capital (20%):** Capital markets access and refinancing capability
4. **Leverage & Coverage (35%):** Debt ratios and interest coverage
5. **Financial Policy (15%):** Distribution policy and growth strategy

### Data Sources

- **Phase 3 Calculated Metrics:** Quantitative financial data (strong evidence)
- **Phase 4 Credit Analysis:** Qualitative assessment (moderate evidence)
- **Rating Methodology Standards:** Industry frameworks (strong evidence)

### Evidence Quality

- **Strong Evidence:** Quantitative metrics from financial statements
- **Moderate Evidence:** Qualitative assessments and scorecard application
- **Limited Evidence:** Business profile, access to capital (requires additional research)

### Key Limitations

1. **Single Point-in-Time Analysis:** Based on {{REPORT_PERIOD}} data only
2. **Limited Historical Data:** Trend analysis requires multi-period data
3. **No Management Guidance:** Forward-looking assumptions not validated by management
4. **Incomplete Debt Schedule:** Maturity profile and covenant details not reviewed
5. **No Market Comparables:** Peer analysis not performed
6. **Limited ESG Data:** Property-level environmental and social metrics not available
7. **Forward-Looking Uncertainty:** Scenario analysis based on assumptions that may not materialize

### Professional Caveats

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:**

- This is credit analysis, **NOT investment advice**
- Final rating decisions require credit committee review and approval
- Analysis based on data from a single reporting period
- Forward-looking statements involve uncertainty and assumptions
- Professional review by qualified credit analysts recommended before any credit decision
- This analysis should not be relied upon as the sole basis for credit decisions
- Additional due diligence required for investment-grade rating confirmation

## Appendix B: Moody's-Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

{{EBITDA_RECONCILIATION}}

---

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**
```
FFO = IFRS Net Income
    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (February 2019)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```
