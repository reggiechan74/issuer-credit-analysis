## Recommendations for Future Analysis

### Priority REITs for Deep-Dive Case Studies
Based on data availability and analytical value:

1. **H&R REIT (May 2020)**
   - Rationale: Most complete financial data, dual stress (pandemic + oil), significant writedowns
   - Available Data: Q1 2020 complete, payout ratios, rent collection, asset values

2. **RioCan REIT (Dec 2020)**
   - Rationale: Largest retail REIT, CEO reversal narrative, detailed Q3 2020 data
   - Available Data: Quarterly financials, portfolio metrics, strategic capital allocation plan

3. **True North Commercial (2023)**
   - Rationale: Unique two-cut case study, clear AFFO data, office sector bellwether
   - Available Data: Q4 2022 financials, AFFO payout progression, both cuts documented

4. **Slate Office REIT (Nov 2023)**
   - Rationale: Portfolio realignment context, detailed debt metrics, occupancy trends

5. **First Capital REIT (Jan 2021)**
   - Rationale: Successful "temporary cut" with restoration, retail sector recovery case
   - Available Data: Cut announcement clear, 2024 restoration documented

### Data Gaps to Address
1. **Share Price Reactions:** Requires Bloomberg/CapitalIQ for precise 30/60/90-day tracking
2. **Credit Ratings:** Moody's/DBRS credit actions pre/post-cut
3. **Analyst Reports:** Sell-side research notes at time of announcements
4. **SEDAR Filings:** MD&A sections from quarters preceding cuts for forward-looking warnings
5. **Insider Trading:** CEO/CFO unit sales before cut announcements (SEDI database)

### Analytical Extensions
1. **Payout Ratio Thresholds:** Regression analysis - at what AFFO payout % does cut probability exceed 50%?
2. **Sector Vulnerability:** Statistical significance of office vs. retail vs. industrial cut rates
3. **Recovery Timelines:** How long until distributions restored to pre-cut levels?
4. **Credit Spread Impact:** Bond yield widening pre/post announcement
5. **Peer Comparison:** REITs that DIDN'T cut (CAPREIT, SmartCentres) - what differentiated them?

---

## Conclusion

This research successfully identified **13 documented distribution cuts** by Canadian REITs from 2015-2025, exceeding the minimum target of 10 cases. The data reveals clear patterns:

**Predictive Indicators:**
- AFFO payout ratios >100% (universal warning sign)
- Office/retail sector exposure during external shocks
- Geographic concentration in distressed markets (Calgary 2015-2018)
- Rising debt metrics (LTV >60%) combined with declining occupancy

**Resilient Characteristics:**
- Residential REITs (especially apartments) largely avoided cuts
- Industrial REITs showed strong distribution stability
- Conservative payout ratios (<85%) provided buffer during crises
- Diversified geographic portfolios reduced single-market risk

**For Credit Analysis Use:**
The cases with strongest pre-cut financial data (H&R, RioCan, Slate Office, True North) provide the best foundation for modeling distribution cut risk factors and testing predictive metrics like AFFO payout thresholds, debt service coverage, and occupancy trends.
