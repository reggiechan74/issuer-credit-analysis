# Why I Built This

---

Let me tell you a story.

It's 3am. You're still at your desk. You've been working on this credit analysis for six hours.

Six. Hours.

And you're only halfway through.

Your eyes are burning from staring at PDFs. Your back hurts from hunching over your desk. You've copied so many numbers from one screen to another that your hand is cramping.

And somewhere around hour four, you realized something:

**This is insane.**

This is 2025. We have cars that drive themselves. We have phones that recognize your face. We have AI that can write poetry and paint pictures.

**And credit analysts are still copying numbers from PDFs. By hand. Like it's 1985.**

I sat there at 3am and thought: There has to be a better way.

## The Thing Nobody Talks About

Here's what they don't tell you when you become a credit analyst:

**You don't analyze credit. You copy numbers.**

You spend your entire day hunting through financial statements, finding data, copying it to Excel, checking it twice, then doing calculations that should be automatic.

By the time you're done, you're exhausted.

**And that's when they ask you to make the actual decision:** Is this credit good or bad?

Your brain is fried. You've been in the weeds for hours. You've lost perspective.

**This is backwards.**

You should spend your time *thinking*. Making judgments. Using your brain for what brains are actually good at.

Instead, you're a human copy machine.

## What They Tried (And Why It Doesn't Work)

"Just use AI!" they said. "Upload it to ChatGPT! Problem solved!"

So you try it.

And it fails. Or it gives you wrong numbers. Or it costs $150. Or it takes 20 minutes and you still don't trust it.

**This is not a solution. This is a different kind of broken.**

---

## The Moment Everything Changed

I was sitting there one day, staring at yet another REIT about to cut its distribution.

And I thought: *This should be automatic. Not 6 hours of manual work.*

**Why doesn't this just... work?**

And then it hit me.

Everyone's trying to solve the wrong problem. They're trying to make AI smarter, bigger, faster.

**What if we just made it simpler?**

What if we stopped trying to do everything at once? What if we broke it down into steps, like cooking a meal?

**What if we just let each piece do what it does best?**

---

## What I Built

I built a tool that runs automatically.

You give it two PDFs. Financial statements. Management discussion. Whatever you've got.

**You hit go. You get coffee. 30 minutes later, you have a complete credit analysis.**

Not a draft. Not a summary. **A complete, professional credit opinion.**

With all the metrics calculated. All the analysis done. Distribution cut prediction. Peer comparison. Scenario analysis. Everything.

**It just works.**

Every single time.

## The Part I'm Most Proud Of

There's a piece of this tool that predicts when REITs will cut their distributions.

12 months in advance.

I tested it on a REIT that was in trouble. Deep trouble. Burning cash. Barely surviving.

The old way of looking at it said: "Everything's fine. Risk is very low."

**My tool said: "This is a disaster waiting to happen. 67% chance they cut."**

**That's the difference between losing money and saving it.**

That's the difference between getting caught off guard and seeing it coming.

That's the difference between being a human spreadsheet and being an actual analyst.

## What This Actually Means For You

When you use this tool, something changes.

**You get your life back.**

No more 3am nights copying numbers.
No more eye strain from reading 75-page PDFs.
No more feeling like a glorified data entry clerk.

**You get to think again.**

You get to use your judgment. Your experience. Your intuition.

You know that feeling when you look at a company and something just feels... off? When the numbers look okay but your gut tells you there's a problem?

**You finally have time to listen to that feeling.**

Because you're not exhausted from six hours of copying numbers.

---

## Why Simple Wins

People always want to make things more complicated.

Bigger. Fancier. More features. More AI. More everything.

**I went the other way.**

I asked: What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?

And I built that.

**No complexity. No fancy stuff. Just: Does it work?**

And you know what? **It works better than all the complicated approaches.**

Because simple things work. Complicated things break.

---

## The Moment I Knew

I ran the tool on a real company for the first time.

I uploaded the PDFs. I hit go. I got a coffee.

I came back. 30 minutes had passed.

There on my screen: a 40-page credit opinion.

I'm reading it. And I'm thinking: *This is actually good.*

Not "good for AI." Not "good considering it's automated."

**Just good.**

That's when I knew. **We'd changed everything.**

---

## What This Is Really About

This isn't about saving time.
This isn't about saving money.
This isn't even about better credit analysis.

**This is about respect.**

Respect for your time.
Respect for your brain.
Respect for what you're capable of when you're not buried in spreadsheets.

**You didn't become a credit analyst to copy numbers.**

You became an analyst to *analyze*. To think. To make judgment calls that matter.

**You deserve tools that let you do that.**

---

## The Vision

Right now, this tool does real estate credits.

But that's just the beginning.

Because the insight isn't about real estate. **The insight is about how we should work with AI.**

Stop trying to make AI do everything. **Let AI do what AI does best. Let humans do what humans do best.**

**And get out of the way.**

That's the future. For credit analysis. For investment research. For any work that requires judgment.

**The tedious stuff happens automatically. The thinking happens with humans.**

---

## Why I'm Giving This Away

People ask me: "Why open source it? Why not keep it proprietary?"

Because **this matters more than that.**

Somewhere right now, there's a 25-year-old analyst sitting at their desk at 3am, copying numbers from a PDF, wondering if this is really what they signed up for.

**I remember being that person.**

If this tool can give that person their life back, it's worth it.

If this tool can catch one distribution cut before it happens and save someone's portfolio, it's worth it.

**The world doesn't need better data entry. The world needs better thinking.**

And you can't think when you're exhausted from copying numbers.

---

## One More Thing

**Life is short.**

Too short to spend it copying numbers from PDFs.
Too short to do work that could be automated.
Too short to feel like a glorified copy machine.

You're smarter than that.
You deserve better than that.

**The future is here.** Hit go. Get coffee. **It just works.**

**Stop wasting your life on the old way.**
