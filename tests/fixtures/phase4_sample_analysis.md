# Credit Analysis: Artis Real Estate Investment Trust
**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Reporting Period:** Q2 2025

---

## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba (high)

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust is a mid-sized Canadian REIT with a diversified portfolio of 83 properties across office, industrial, and retail asset classes. The credit profile is characterized by moderate leverage at 41.1% Debt/Gross Assets and adequate interest coverage of 2.31x, both consistent with Ba category thresholds. While the portfolio demonstrates operational stability with 89.0% occupancy (including commitments) and positive same-property NOI growth of 2.3%, the REIT faces challenges from an elevated AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% and significant near-term debt maturities.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
- Moderate leverage within Ba range (Debt/Assets: 41.1%)
- Adequate coverage ratios (NOI/Interest: 2.31x)
- Stable portfolio performance (89% occupancy, +2.3% NOI growth)
- Elevated distribution payout constraining financial flexibility

## Credit Strengths

1. **Diversified Portfolio with Operational Stability**
   - 83 properties totaling 9.7 million square feet across multiple asset classes
   - Portfolio occupancy of 89.0% (including commitments) compares favorably to sector averages
   - Positive same-property NOI growth of 2.3% demonstrates pricing power and tenant retention

2. **Geographic Diversification**
   - Balanced exposure across Canada (~47% GLA) and United States (~53% GLA)
   - Mitigates concentration risk from single-market economic cycles

3. **Moderate Leverage Position**
   - Debt/Gross Assets of 41.1% sits at upper end of Baa range (35-45%)
   - Below Ba threshold of 45%, providing modest cushion for asset value volatility

4. **Adequate Debt Service Coverage**
   - NOI/Interest coverage of 2.31x is within Ba range (2.0-3.0x)
   - Provides reasonable buffer for operating volatility

---

## Credit Challenges

1. **Unsustainable Distribution Payout**
   - AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% indicates distributions exceed cash flow generation
   - FFO payout of 88.2% also elevated, limiting retained cash for growth or deleveraging
   - **Mitigant:** Management may reduce distributions to improve financial flexibility

2. **Limited Financial Flexibility**
   - High payout ratios constrain ability to fund growth or weather downturns from internal cash
   - Reliance on external capital markets for refinancing and growth

3. **Asset Class Exposure to Structural Headwinds**
   - Office portfolio (54.7% of GLA) faces long-term challenges from hybrid work trends
   - May pressure occupancy, rents, and asset values over time

4. **Refinancing Risk**
   - Moderate interest coverage (2.31x) provides limited cushion if interest rates remain elevated
   - Debt maturity profile not provided but typical for sector includes near-term maturities

---

## Rating Outlook: Stable

**12-18 Month View:** The Stable outlook reflects our expectation that Artis will maintain operational stability with occupancy remaining near current levels and modest NOI growth continuing. We expect leverage to remain in the 40-42% range absent significant asset sales or equity issuance. The key risks to the outlook are potential distribution cuts (which may be credit positive long-term but create near-term uncertainty) and office portfolio performance deterioration.

**Factors Supporting Stable Outlook:**
- Occupancy expected to remain 87-90% range
- Same-property NOI growth to continue at 1-3% annually
- No immediate refinancing stress anticipated (subject to debt maturity profile review)

---

## Upgrade Factors

An upgrade to Baa (low) would require:

1. **Leverage Reduction:** Debt/Gross Assets sustained below 38%
2. **Coverage Improvement:** EBITDA/Interest coverage sustained above 2.75x
3. **Distribution Discipline:** AFFO payout ratio reduced below 100% for 4+ consecutive quarters
4. **Portfolio Quality Enhancement:** Occupancy sustained above 91% with asset class mix shift toward higher-quality/lower-risk segments

**Timeframe:** 18-24 months of sustained improvement required

---

## Downgrade Factors

A downgrade to Ba (low) or B (high) would result from:

1. **Leverage Increase:** Debt/Gross Assets exceeding 45% on a sustained basis
2. **Coverage Deterioration:** EBITDA/Interest coverage falling below 2.0x
3. **Occupancy Decline:** Portfolio occupancy falling below 85% or persistent negative NOI growth
4. **Liquidity Stress:** Inability to refinance maturing debt or distribution cut under distressed circumstances
5. **Asset Value Impairment:** Significant write-downs indicating permanent impairment (>10% of portfolio)

**Triggers could occur within 6-12 months under adverse scenarios**

## 5-Factor Scorecard Analysis

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Ba | Ba | Gross assets of CAD $2.6 billion place Artis in the Ba range ($2-5B). Moderate size provides some operational scale but limits capital markets access relative to larger peers. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Ba/Baa | Ba | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Good quality assets in primary/secondary markets, but office concentration (55% GLA) creates structural risk. **Market Position (12.5%):** Competitive but not dominant positions; balanced geographic diversification mitigates single-market risk. Overall Ba assessment due to asset class headwinds. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Ba | Ba | Moderate access to capital markets. As a TSX-listed REIT with investment-grade scale, Artis can access debt and equity markets, but high payout ratio and moderate size limit financial flexibility. Refinancing risk manageable but present. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Ba | Ba | **Debt/Assets:** 41.1% (Ba range: 35-45%, approaching upper threshold). **Coverage:** 2.31x (Ba range: 2.0-3.0x, mid-range). Metrics solidly Ba, with limited cushion for deterioration. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | B/Ba | Ba | Elevated AFFO payout of 176.5% indicates aggressive distribution policy constraining flexibility. However, FFO payout of 88.2% suggests some coverage at FFO level. Policy leans toward growth/distribution over deleveraging. Assessed at Ba given unsustainable AFFO payout. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Ba** | **Ba** | **Indicated Rating: Ba (high)** - Aggregate assessment points to Ba category. The "high" qualifier reflects positioning at upper end of Ba metrics (leverage near Baa, coverage mid-Ba) with operational stability providing some cushion. |

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**Funds From Operations (FFO):**
- FFO of CAD $34.5 million (Q2 annualized: ~$138M) with FFO per unit of $0.34
- FFO payout ratio of 88.2% is elevated but within acceptable range for mature REITs (typically 70-90%)
- Suggests limited retained cash but not immediately unsustainable

**Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO):**
- AFFO of CAD $16.9 million (Q2 annualized: ~$68M) with AFFO per unit of $0.17
- **Critical concern:** AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% indicates distributions significantly exceed adjusted cash flow
- This is unsustainable and will require distribution cuts, asset sales, or equity issuance to address

**Distribution Sustainability:**
- Current distributions of $0.30 per unit exceed AFFO of $0.17 per unit by 76%
- To achieve 90% AFFO payout (sustainable level), distributions would need to decrease to ~$0.15 per unit (50% cut)
- Alternatively, AFFO growth through NOI improvement and capex efficiency could close gap over time

### Portfolio Quality Assessment

**Occupancy:**
- Physical occupancy: 87.8%
- Occupancy including commitments: 89.0%
- **Assessment:** Good occupancy for a diversified REIT; slightly below pre-pandemic norms (91-93%) but stable

**Same-Property NOI Growth:**
- Year-to-date growth: 2.3%
- **Assessment:** Positive trend indicates pricing power and effective asset management
- Above inflation (assuming 2% CPI) suggests real rent growth

**Portfolio Composition Concerns:**
- Office: 54.7% of GLA (high exposure to structural headwinds)
- Industrial: 34.4% of GLA (positive secular trends)
- Retail: 10.9% of GLA (selective exposure)
- **Assessment:** Office concentration creates long-term risk; industrial allocation is credit-positive

### Unusual Ratios or Trends

1. **AFFO vs. FFO Gap:** The large divergence (AFFO 49% of FFO) suggests high capital expenditures or non-cash adjustments. This is concerning if capex intensity is structural rather than one-time.

2. **Leverage Trajectory:** At 41.1%, leverage is moderate but provides limited cushion to Ba threshold (45%). Any asset value decline >9% would push into B territory.

3. **Coverage Flatness:** NOI/Interest coverage of 2.31x is adequate but not strong. With limited margin for error, any NOI decline or interest rate increase would pressure coverage quickly.
