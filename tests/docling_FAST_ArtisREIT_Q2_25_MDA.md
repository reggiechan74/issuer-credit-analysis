## Management's Discussion and Analysis - Q2-25

(in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted)

The following management's discussion and analysis ("MD&amp;A") of the financial condition and results of operations of Artis Real  Estate  Investment  Trust  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  REIT's  unaudited  interim  condensed  consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the audited annual consolidation financial statements for years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the notes thereto. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts in this MD&amp;A are based on the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS ®  Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IFRS Accounting Standards").  Additionally, "Artis", and the "REIT", refers to  Artis  Real  Estate  Investment  Trust  and  its  consolidated  operations.    This  MD&amp;A  has  been  prepared  taking  into  account material transactions and events up to and including August 7, 2025.  Additional information, including the REIT's most recent Annual Information Form, has been filed with applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities and is available on Artis's website at www.artisreit.com or SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

## FORWARD-LOOKING DISCLAIMER

This MD&amp;A contains certain statements which are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained or incorporated by reference herein may be deemed to be forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding the timing and amount of distributions and the future financial position, business strategy, potential acquisitions and dispositions, plans and objectives of Artis. Forwardlooking statements reflect management's expectations regarding future growth, results of operations, performance, prospects and  opportunities  of  Artis.  Without  limiting  the  foregoing,  the  words  'expects',  'anticipates',  'intends',  'estimates', 'projects',  and  similar  expressions  or  variations  of  such  words  and  phrases  are  intended  to  identify  forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on information currently available to management. Artis cannot assure investors that the actual results will be consistent with any forward-looking statements and, other than as required by applicable law, Artis assumes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements to reflect  actual  events  or  new  circumstances.  All  forward-looking  statements  contained  in  this  MD&amp;A  are  qualified  by  this cautionary statement.

Forward-looking statements may involve significant risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in forward-looking statements including risks relating to the strategy, real  property  ownership,  overall  investment  portfolio,  geographic  concentration,  current  economic  conditions,  strategic initiatives,  pandemics  and  other  public  health  events,  debt  financing,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  foreign  currency,  tenants, specified investment flow-through ("SIFT") rules, other tax-related factors, illiquidity, competition, reliance on key personnel, future  property  transactions,  general  uninsured  losses,  dependence  on  information  technology  systems,  cyber  security, environmental matters and climate change, land and air rights leases, public market, market price of common units, changes in  legislation  and  investment  eligibility,  availability  of  cash  flow,  fluctuations  in  cash  distributions,  nature  of  units  and  legal rights  attaching  to  units,  preferred  units,  debentures,  dilution,  unitholder  liability,  failure  to  obtain  additional  financing, potential conflicts of interest, developments, and trustees.

In particular, any proposed acquisitions and dispositions described herein or in documents incorporated by reference herein are, in certain cases, subject to conditions that may not be satisfied and there can be no assurance that such acquisitions and dispositions will be completed.

The Tax Act contains the SIFT Rules, which are applicable to SIFTs and investors in SIFTs, but do not apply to trusts that satisfy the REIT Exception. As at the date of this MD&amp;A, Artis satisfies the REIT Exception and intends to continue to satisfy the REIT Exception so that the SIFT Rules will not apply to Artis. Should this not occur, certain statements contained in this MD&amp;A relating  to  the  SIFT  Rules  and  the  REIT  Exception  relating  to  Artis  and  its  holders  of  common  units  would  no  longer  be applicable.

For more information on the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the Artis's actual results to materially differ from current expectations, refer to the section entitled 'Risk Factors' of Artis's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2024 as well as Artis's other public filings, available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

## NOTICE WITH RESPECT TO NON-GAAP &amp; SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL MEASURES DISCLOSURE

In addition to reported IFRS Accounting Standards measures, certain non-GAAP and supplementary financial measures are commonly  used  by  Canadian  real  estate  investment  trusts  as  an  indicator  of  financial  performance.  "GAAP"  means  the generally accepted accounting principles described by the CPA Canada Handbook - Accounting, which are applicable as at the date on which any calculation using GAAP is to be made. Artis applies IFRS Accounting Standards, which is the section of GAAP applicable to publicly accountable enterprises.

Non-GAAP  measures  and  ratios  include  Same  Property  Net  Operating  Income  ("Same  Property  NOI"),  Funds  From Operations  ("FFO"),  Adjusted  Funds  from  Operations  ("AFFO"),  FFO  per  Unit,  AFFO  per  Unit,  FFO  Payout  Ratio,  AFFO Payout  Ratio,  Net  Asset  Value  ("NAV"),  NAV  per  Unit,  Gross  Book  Value  ("GBV"),  Total  Debt  to  GBV,  Adjusted  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio and Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.

Supplementary financial measures include percentage of unhedged variable rate mortgage debt, excess (shortfall) of cash flow from operations over distributions declared and excess (shortfall) of net income over distributions declared.

Management believes that these measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of Artis's performance and provide a relevant basis for comparison among real estate entities.

These  non-GAAP  and  supplementary  financial  measures  are  not  defined  under  IFRS  Accounting  Standards  and  are  not intended to represent financial performance, financial position or cash flows for the period, nor should any of these measures be viewed as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

A description of the composition and a reconciliation to each of these measures to the nearest IFRS Accounting Standards measure can be found in the MD&amp;A sections as outlined below:

| Non-GAAP / Supplementary Financial Measure                                                                                                | MD&A Section                  |

The above measures are not standardized financial measures under the financial reporting framework used to prepare the financial statements of Artis.  Readers should be further cautioned that the above measures as calculated by Artis may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.

## BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Artis is a diversified commercial real estate investment trust and is an unincorporated closed-end real estate investment trust, created under, and governed by, the laws of the Province of Manitoba.  The REIT was created pursuant to the Declaration of Trust dated November 8, 2004, as most recently amended and restated on December 19, 2021 (the "Declaration of Trust").

Certain of the REIT's securities are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX").  The REIT's common units trade under the symbol AX.UN and the REIT's preferred units trade under the symbols AX.PR.E and AX.PR.I.  The REIT's common units also trade in the United States ("U.S.") on the OTCQX Best Market ("OTCQX"), under the symbol ARESF.

As at August 7, 2025, there were 96,617,287 common units, 7,150,565 preferred units, 721,165 restricted units and 551,472 deferred units of Artis outstanding (refer to the Outstanding Unit Data section of this MD&amp;A for further details).

## VISION

Artis's vision is to become a best-in-class real estate asset management and investment platform focused on value investing.

## BUSINESS STRATEGY

Artis's  strategy  is  to  generate  meaningful  long-term  growth  in  net  asset  value  per  unit  by  strengthening  its  balance  sheet, driving organic growth and value investing. As part of this strategy, Artis will concentrate its ownership in the highest and best risk adjusted return opportunities in an effort to maximize long-term value for unitholders.

## Business Strategy Update

## Dispositions

The REIT has been unlocking value through the monetization of certain assets. During the second quarter of 2025, Artis sold one retail property located in Canada for a sale price of $4,750.

The  REIT  will  continue  to  evaluate  the  sale  of  a  portion  of  its  industrial,  office  and  retail  assets  in  an  opportunistic  and disciplined manner, with the goal of selling assets at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values and maximizing value on a tax-efficient basis.

## Normal Course Issuer Bid

Artis continues to view its Normal Course Issuer Bid ("NCIB") as a valuable tool to enhance unitholder value.

The  REIT  renewed  the  NCIB  effective  December  19,  2024  and,  under  the  terms  of  the  NCIB,  the  REIT  may  purchase  a maximum of 4,975,917 common units, 291,560 Series E preferred units and 421,775 Series I preferred units. As at June 30, 2025,  the  REIT  had  purchased  3,803,458  common  units  at  a  weighted-average  price  of  $7.42  under  the  current  term.  The common units were purchased at a significant discount to NAV per unit of $12.98 at June 30, 2025.

## Operations and Developments

Organic  growth  is  an  important  element  of  Artis's  strategy.    Artis's  management  is  focused  on  identifying  operational efficiencies, increasing occupancy and in-place rents, and the completion of new development projects.

Occupancy  at  June  30,  2025,  improved  to  87.8%  (89.0%  including  commitments),  compared  to  87.1%  at  March  31,  2025. During  the  second  quarter,  126,306  square  feet  of  new  leases  and  210,643  square  feet  of  renewals  commenced.  These renewals were negotiated at a weighted-average rental increase when compared to expiring rents of 3.6%.

## Strategic Value Investments

At June 30, 2025, Artis held equity securities with an aggregate fair value of $58,823.

## DBRS Credit Rating

At  June  30,  2025,  Artis  had  an  Issuer  Rating  from  DBRS  Limited  ("Morningstar  DBRS")  of  BB  (high)  with  a  Stable  trend. Following the repayment of Artis's senior unsecured debentures during the second quarter of 2025, the ratings for both the senior unsecured debentures and the REIT's preferred trust units were discontinued.

The successful execution of Artis's strategy requires suitable opportunities, careful timing, patience and business judgment, as well as sufficient resources to make investments and restructure them, if required.  There can be no assurance that the REIT will be able to execute its strategy or to identify suitable or sufficient opportunities to monetize or maximize the value of its existing portfolio of assets or to make investments that satisfy its investment criteria at attractive prices, in either case, in a timely manner, or at all.

## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

Occupancy including commitments was 89.0% at June 30, 2025, compared to 89.1% at March 31, 2025.  During the second quarter, 126,306 square feet of new leases and 210,643 square feet of renewals commenced. The renewal rates represented a weighted-average increase of 3.6% over expiring rates.  This marks the eighteenth consecutive quarter of growth in weightedaverage rental rates on renewals.  Year-over-year Same Property NOI growth for the six months ended June 30, 2025, was 2.3%.  The increase in weighted-average renewal rents and Same Property NOI growth are important indicators of the stability and growth profile of the REIT's portfolio.

During the second quarter, Artis sold one retail property located in Canada for a sale price of $4,750.

Going forward, Artis is committed to strengthening its balance sheet and, more specifically, reducing debt and increasing liquidity through its disposition strategy. The REIT renewed the NCIB effective December 19, 2024 and, under the terms of the NCIB, the REIT may purchase a maximum of 4,975,917 common units, 291,560 Series E preferred units and 421,775 Series I preferred units. As at June 30, 2025, t he REIT purchased 3,803,458 common units at a weighted-average price of $7.42 under the  current  term .  These  units  were  purchased  at  a  significant  discount  to  NAV  per  unit  of  $12.98  at  June  30,  2025. Artis continues to view the NCIB as a compelling tool to enhance unitholder value and, when permitted, will continue to focus on buying back units using the NCIB if Artis's units continue to trade at a material discount to its NAV per unit.  Further, the Board may consider additional mechanisms that are available to the REIT for returning capital to unitholders, including, subject to market and other conditions, other unit repurchases.

## Financial and Operational Results

Revenue  and  net  operating  income  were  primarily  impacted  by  property  dispositions  throughout  2024  and  2025  and  by development fee income recorded in the second quarter of 2024.

Artis reported portfolio occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% including commitments) at June 30, 2025, compared to 87.1% at March 31, 2025.  During the second quarter, 126,306 square feet of new leases and 210,643 square feet of lease renewals commenced. The  weighted-average  increase  in  renewal  rents  compared  to  expiring  rents  on  renewals  that  began  during  the  second quarter was 3.6%.

Net (loss) income was impacted by the expected credit loss on preferred investments ($26,000 in Q2-25, compared to $nil in Q2-24), fair value change on investment properties (loss of $7,958 in Q2-25, compared to a gain of $13,437 in Q2-24), interest and  other  income  ($681  in  Q2-25,  compared  to  $7,644  in  Q2-24),  income  tax  (expense  of  $731  in  Q2-25,  compared  to  a recovery of $1,245 in Q2-24), distribution income from equity securities ($806 in Q2-25, compared to $1,854 in Q2-24), and corporate expenses ($3,639 in Q2-25, compared to $2,897 in Q2-24).

Partially offsetting the above decreases to net income was net income (loss) from equity accounted investments (net income of $1,270 in Q2-25 compared to net loss of $31,433 in Q2-24), interest expense ($16,937 in Q2-25, compared to $31,145 in Q2-24), fair value change on financial instruments (loss of $1,961 in Q2-25, compared to a loss of $3,672 in Q2-24), and equity securities expenses ($62 in Q2-25, compared to $169 in Q2-24).

Foreign exchange had an impact on Artis's financial results, due to a higher US dollar to Canadian dollar average exchange rate of 1.3841 in Q2-25, compared to 1.3684 in Q2-24.

FFO per unit (diluted) for Q2-25 was $0.17, compared to $0.27 for Q2-24, while AFFO per unit (diluted) for Q2-25 was $0.08, compared to $0.16 for Q2-24.  FFO in Q2-25 was primarily impacted by decreased net operating income due to dispositions completed in 2024 and 2025, decreased interest and other income, and decreased distributions from equity securities due to sales, partially offset by decreased interest expense.

FFO and AFFO per unit results are also impacted by the decrease in the weighted-average number of units outstanding, primarily due to units repurchased under the NCIB.

The REIT reported FFO and AFFO payout ratios of 88.2% and 187.5%, for the second quarter of 2025.

## Balance Sheet and Liquidity

During  Q2-25,  Artis  drew  a  net  balance  of  $232,584  on  its  revolving  credit  facilities.  Proceeds  were  primarily  used  for  the repayment of the Series E senior unsecured debentures upon maturity with a face value of $200,000. Artis reported a total debt to GBV of 41.1% at June 30, 2025, compared to 40.2% at December 31, 2024.

In Q2-25, Artis utilized the NCIB to purchase 1,771,089 common units for an aggregate market price of $12,892, and 25,700 Series E and 33,200 Series I preferred units for an aggregate market price of $1,180.

At June 30, 2025, NAV per unit was $12.98, compared to $13.75 at December 31, 2024.  The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, distributions made to unitholders, the expected credit loss on preferred investments, interest expense,  corporate  expense  and  the  fair  value  loss  on  financial  instruments,  partially  offset  by  net  operating  income,  the impact of units purchased under the NCIB, distributions from equity securities and interest and other income.

## Distributions

In  Q2-25,  Artis  declared  distributions  of  $17,823  (YTD  -  $35,949)  to  unitholders,  which  included  distributions  to  preferred unitholders in the amount of $3,165 (YTD - $6,360).

Prairie  Ridge  Centre,  a  retail  property  in  Grande  Prairie,  Alberta,  was  vacated  by  a  large  tenant,  providing  Artis  with  an opportunity  to  redevelop  and  reconfigure  this  older  generation  space  to  accommodate  multiple  tenants.  Redevelopment work is substantially complete and efforts to lease the property are under way.

## Residential Portfolio

The sites are located above the Shops of Winnipeg Square retail concourse and Winnipeg Square Parkade, and adjacent to 360 Main, a 30storey Class A office tower, all of which are owned by Artis.  300 Main is a best-in-class amenity-rich apartment building with main floor commercial space.

Of the total building GLA, 18,481 square feet is commercial space. During 2022, Earls Kitchen &amp; Bar, occupying 7,397 square feet, moved into their space on the main floor of the building.

The residential component of the building totals 395 units.  Phase I, which comprises the first 20 floors of the building, was delivered to the market in Q3-23 and was 90.9% leased at June 30, 2025.

## PORTFOLIO LEASING ACTIVITY AND LEASE EXPIRIES

## Renewal Summary  (1)

|                                          | Q2-25   | Q1-25   | Q4-24   | Q3-24   | Q2-24   |
|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Leasable area renewed (in S.F.)          | 210,643 | 122,760 | 204,564 | 146,979 | 100,365 |
| Increase in weighted-average rental rate | 3.6%    | 4.0%    | 3.3%    | 2.5%    | 3.1%    |

(1) Based on owned share of GLA of properties and excludes properties held in equity accounted investments, properties held for redevelopment, and Artis's commercial/residential property (300 Main). Refer to the Property Portfolio section of this MD&amp;A.

In Q2-25, 210,643 square feet were renewed at an increase in the weighted-average rental rate of 3.6%, compared to 100,365 square feet renewed at an increase in the weighted-average rental rate of 3.1% in Q2-24.

The percentage change on renewal activity is calculated by comparing the rental rate in place at the end of the expiring term to the rental rate in place at the commencement of the new term.  In many cases, leases are negotiated or renewed such that there are contractual rent escalations over the course of the new lease term.  In these cases, the average rent over the new term will be higher than the rate at commencement, which is not reflected in the above table results.

## Lease Maturities and Rental Rates

In-place rental rates reflect the weighted-average net annual rental rate per square foot as at June 30, 2025, for the leasable area expiring in the year indicated.  In-place rents do not reflect either the average rate over the term of the lease or the rate in place in the year of expiry.

Market rents are estimates and are shown as a net annual rate per square foot.  Artis reviews market rents across the portfolio on an on-going basis.  These estimates are based on management's best estimate for each leasable space and may take into consideration  the  property  manager's  revenue  budget,  recent  leasing  activity,  current  prospects,  future  commitments  or publicly available market information.  Rates applied in future expiry years do not allow for the impact of inflation, nor do they attempt  to  factor  in  anticipated  higher  (or  lower)  than  normal  periods  of  demand  or  market  rent  inflation  due  to  specific market conditions.  Refer to the Risks and Uncertainties section of this MD&amp;A for further information.

The  following  tables  contain  information  on  lease  maturities  and  rental  rates  and  are  based  on  owned  share  of  GLA  of properties  included  in  the  Portfolio  by  Asset  Class  table  in  the  Property  Portfolio  section  of  this  MD&amp;A.    Monthly  tenants includes holdovers and renewals where term has not been negotiated.

Rental and other income is primarily revenue earned from tenants related to lease agreements.

Tenant inducement costs are amortized over the term of the tenant's lease.

Rent steps and lease termination income (if it is likely the tenant will exercise the lease termination option) are accounted for by  straight-lining  the  incremental  increases  and  lease  termination  payments  over  the  entire  non-cancelable  lease  term, including the tenant fixturing period.

Lease termination income relates to payments received from tenants where the REIT and the tenant agreed to terminate a lease  prior  to  the  contractual  expiry  date.    Lease  termination  income  is  common  in  the  real  estate  industry,  however,  it  is unpredictable and period-over-period changes are not indicative of trends.

Property  operating  expenses  include  costs  related  to  interior  and  exterior  maintenance,  insurance,  utilities  and  property management expenses.   Also  included  in  property  operating  expenses  is  bad  debt  expense  of  $64  (YTD  -  $97)  in  Q2-25 compared to $459 (YTD - $559)  in Q2-24.

In  Q2-25,  the  Canadian  retail/residential  and  the  U.S.  industrial  segments  decreased  primarily  due  to  dispositions.  The Canadian retail/residential segment was partially offset by increased occupancy at 300 Main. The REIT segment decreased due to development fee income in the prior period.

The U.S. portfolio was also impacted by the effect of foreign exchange.

See below for breakdown of net operating income by asset class, excluding the REIT segment.

## SAME PROPERTY NOI ANALYSIS

Same Property NOI is  a  non-GAAP  measure.  Refer  to  the  Notice  with  Respect  to  Non-GAAP  &amp;  Supplementary  Measures Disclosure section of this MD&amp;A.

Artis calculates Same Property NOI by including net operating income for investment properties that were owned for a full quarterly reporting period in both the current and comparative year, and excludes properties held for (re)development and properties that are unconditionally sold. Same Property NOI includes Artis's portfolio of investment properties and investment properties held in joint venture arrangements.  Adjustments are made to this measure to exclude certain non-cash revenue items and other non-recurring revenue amounts.  Lease termination income related to significant tenants has been excluded, other than the portion that covers lost revenue due to vacancy.

Management considers Same Property NOI to be a valuable measure for evaluating the operating performance of the REIT's properties due to changes in occupancy, rental rates and the recovery of property operating expenses and realty taxes.

(1) Amounts shown are in Canadian and US dollars.

During  Q2-25,  interest  expense  on  mortgages  and  other  loans  decreased  due  to  the  repayment  of  mortgages  upon disposition of investment properties and maturity, and decreased variable interest rates.   Interest expense on credit facilities decreased due to amounts drawn on the credit facilities and decreased variable interest rates. Interest expense on senior unsecured debentures decreased due to the repayment of the Series E senior unsecured debentures on April 29, 2025.

Financing costs on mortgages and other loans, senior unsecured debentures and the credit facilities are netted against the related debt and amortized on an effective interest basis over the expected term of the debt.

At  June  30,  2025,  the  weighted-average  effective  interest  rate  on  mortgages  and  other  loans  secured  by  properties,  was 6.71%, compared to 6.95% at December 31, 2024.  The weighted-average nominal interest rate on mortgages and other loans secured by properties at June 30, 2025, was 6.21%, compared to 6.32% at December 31, 2024.

Corporate expenses in Q2-25 were $3,639 (YTD - $6,923), or 6.2% (YTD - 5.7%) of total revenues compared to $2,897 (YTD $5,179) or 3.4% (YTD -  3.1%) of total revenues in Q2-24.

Public company costs include public reporting costs, investor communication costs and trustee fees and expenses.

Fair value (gain) loss on unit-based compensation relates to restricted units and deferred units issued under the REIT's equity incentive plan.  These units are valued at the closing price of the REIT's common units on the balance sheet date.  Unit-based compensation was impacted by fluctuations in Artis's unit price during the period.

Corporate strategy expenses are non-recurring costs related to Artis's business strategy.

## EQUITY SECURITIES EXPENSES

The  REIT  invests  in  equity  securities  of  publicly-traded  Canadian  entities.    In  connection  with  these  investments,  the  REIT incurred commissions, service and professional fees of $62 (YTD - $145) in Q2-25, compared to $169 (YTD - $342) in Q2-24.

Included in equity securities expenses are fees paid to Sandpiper Asset Management Inc. ("Sandpiper").  Refer to the Related Party Transactions section of this MD&amp;A for further details.

## EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS ON PREFERRED INVESTMENTS

Expected credit loss on preferred investments was $26,000 (YTD - $34,184) in Q2-25, compared to $nil (YTD - $nil) in Q2-24. Refer to Preferred Investments section of this MD&amp;A for further details.

## FAIR VALUE (LOSS) GAIN ON INVESTMENT PROPERTIES

The changes in fair value on investment properties, period-over-period, are recognized as fair value gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations.  Fair values of the investment properties are determined through either the discounted cash  flow  method  or  the  overall  capitalization  method.  External  valuations  are  performed  for  a  selection  of  properties representing  various  geographical  regions  and  asset  classes  across  the  REIT's  portfolio.  Fair  value  changes  in  individual properties result from changes in the projected income and cash flow projections of those properties, as well as from changes in capitalization rates and discount rates applied. In Q2-25, the fair value loss on investment properties was $7,958 (YTD - loss of $862), compared to a gain of $13,437 (YTD - gain of $12,437) in Q2-24. The fair value loss in Q2-25 was primarily due to increases  in  vacancy  in  select  U.S.  and  Canadian  office  markets  and  lower  expected  market  rents  in  the  Twin  Cities  Area, Minnesota office market. This was partially offset by a fair value gain due to capitalization rate compression at an industrial property located in the Greater Houston Area, Texas.

## FAIR VALUE (LOSS) GAIN ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Artis has entered into a number of interest rate swap contracts to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of variable rate debt. The REIT recorded an unrealized gain on the fair value adjustment of the interest rate swaps outstanding of $1,664 (YTD -  loss of $48) in Q2-25, compared to an unrealized loss of $1,027 (YTD - gain of $2,428) in Q2-24. The REIT anticipates holding the mortgages and related interest rate swap contracts until maturity.

Additionally, the REIT recorded a fair value loss on equity securities of $3,625 (YTD - loss of $3,101) in Q2-25, compared to a loss of $2,645 (YTD - loss of $7,122) in Q2-24.

## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION GAIN (LOSS)

Artis  held  certain  US  dollar  denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including cash and a portion of its revolving term credit facilities. The foreign currency translation gain (loss) is primarily due to remeasurement of these assets and liabilities into Canadian dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The REIT recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $310 (YTD - gain of $327) in Q2-25, compared to a loss of $1,987 (YTD - loss of $6,425) in Q2-24.

## INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) RECOVERY

The REIT currently qualifies as a mutual fund trust and a real estate investment trust for Canadian income tax purposes.  Under current tax legislation, income distributed annually by the REIT to unitholders is a deduction in the calculation of its taxable income.  As the REIT intends to distribute all of its taxable income to its unitholders, the REIT does not record a provision for current Canadian income taxes related to the Canadian investment properties. The REIT's investment in Iris Acquisition II LP (see Other Investments section of this MD&amp;A for further details) is through a taxable subsidiary subject to current and deferred taxes.

The REIT's U.S. properties are owned by subsidiaries that are REITs for U.S. income tax purposes.  These subsidiaries intend to distribute  all  of  their  U.S.  taxable  income  to  Canada  and  are  entitled  to  deduct  such  distributions  for  U.S.  income  tax purposes.    As  a  result,  the  REIT  does  not  record  a  provision  for  current  federal  U.S.  income  taxes  on  the  taxable  income earned by these subsidiaries.  These U.S. subsidiaries are subject to certain state taxes and a 21% to 30% withholding tax on distributions to Canada.  Any withholding taxes paid are recorded with the related distributions.  The REIT is subject to federal and state taxation in the U.S. on the taxable income earned by its U.S. management subsidiary.

Income tax expense (recovery) comprised of:

| Income tax expense (recovery)          | $ 731                | $ (1,245)            | $ 985                       | $ (2,677)                   |

The deferred tax recovery recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the REIT's share of net loss of Iris for the quarter. The deferred taxes are recorded at the undistributed rate of tax.  Actual taxes payable are expected to be reduced due to the benefit of dividend refunds.

## OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME

Other comprehensive (loss) income includes unrealized foreign currency translation losses of $46,808 (YTD - losses of $47,597) in Q2-25, compared to gains of $11,917 (YTD - gains of $39,708) in Q2-24.  Foreign currency translation gains and losses relate to the REIT's net investments in its U.S. subsidiaries.

## FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ("FFO") AND ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ("AFFO")

FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP measures.  Management considers FFO and AFFO to be valuable recurring earnings measures for evaluating the REIT's operating performance.  Refer to the Notice with Respect to Non-GAAP &amp; Supplementary Measures Disclosure section of this MD&amp;A.

Artis  calculates  FFO  and  AFFO  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  set  out  by  the  Real  Property  Association  of  Canada ("REALpac"),  as  issued  in  January  2022,  except  for  the  add-back  of  corporate  strategy  expenses.  In  addition,  prior  to December 31, 2024, the REIT calculated FFO and AFFO both including and excluding the impact of realized gain (loss) on equity securities for information purposes. Effective December 31, 2024, the REIT only presents the calculation including the impact  of  realized  gain  (loss)  on  equity  securities  (and  excludes  the  unrealized  gains  or  losses  of  equity  securities)  in  its calculation of FFO and AFFO. Although the add-back of the corporate strategy expenses and the inclusion of the impact of realized gain (loss) on equity securities to arrive at FFO and AFFO is not in accordance with the guidelines set out by REALpac, management believes it provides a better representation of recurring operating performance, FFO and AFFO.  FFO adjusts net income for items that are non-cash or not recurring in nature such as fair value gains or losses on investment properties and financial instruments, foreign currency translation gains and losses, tenant inducements amortized to revenue, deferred income  taxes,  distributions  on  preferred  shares  treated  as  interest  expense,  remeasurement  component  of  unit-based compensation, incremental leasing costs, and preferred unit distributions.  AFFO adjusts FFO by excluding straight-line rent adjustments, as well as costs incurred relating to leasing activities and property capital expenditures.  FFO and AFFO include adjustments related to the REIT's equity accounted investments.

In addition, the REIT recorded an expected credit loss on the preferred units of Iris (Refer to Preferred Investments section of this MD&amp;A for further details) in 2025.  The expected credit loss was added back to the calculations of FFO and AFFO due to its  non-recurring and non-cash nature.  Management believes this adjustment provides a better representation of recurring FFO and AFFO.

FFO in Q2-25 was primarily impacted by decreased net operating income due to dispositions completed in 2024 and 2025, decreased  interest  and  other  income,  and  decreased  distributions  from  equity  securities  due  to  sales,  partially  offset  by decreased interest expense.

Actual capital expenditures are by nature variable. Recoverable capital expenditures are building improvement or property maintenance expenditures recovered from tenants over time.  Management has deducted from AFFO the actual amortization of recoverable capital expenditures included in property operating expenses charged to tenants for the period, including joint venture arrangements.  Approximately 60.3% (YTD - 60.5%) is recoverable from tenants in Q2-25, compared to 63.6% (YTD 65.1%)  in  Q2-24.  The  non-recoverable  property  maintenance  reserve  reflects  management's  estimate  of  a  normalized expenditure using the 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 actual expenditures and the 2025 annual budgeted expenditures, adjusted for the impact of dispositions.  Refer to the capital expenditures disclosure under the Assets section of this MD&amp;A for further discussion of actual expenditures for the period.

Actual leasing costs include tenant improvements, tenant allowances and commissions which are variable in nature.  Leasing costs will fluctuate depending on the square footage of leases rolling over, in-place rates at expiry, tenant retention and local market conditions in a given year. Management calculates the leasing cost reserve to reflect the amortization of leasing costs over the related lease term.

## FFO and AFFO per Unit

FFO per unit and AFFO per unit are non-GAAP ratios.  Refer to the Notice with Respect to Non-GAAP &amp; Supplementary Measures Disclosure section of this MD&amp;A.

Artis  calculates  FFO  and  AFFO  per  unit  by  dividing  FFO  and  AFFO,  respectively,  by  the  weighted-average  diluted  units outstanding  for  the  period.  Management  considers  FFO  per  unit  and  AFFO  per  unit  to  be  valuable  recurring  earnings measures for evaluating the REIT's operating performance.

The following reconciles the weighted-average number of basic common units to diluted common units for FFO and AFFO purposes:

FFO and AFFO per unit results have been impacted by the decrease in the weighted-average number of units outstanding, primarily due to units repurchased under the NCIB.

## FFO and AFFO Payout Ratios

FFO  payout  ratio  and  AFFO  payout  ratio  are  non-GAAP  ratios.    Refer  to  the  Notice  with  Respect  to  Non-GAAP  &amp; Supplementary Measures Disclosure section of this MD&amp;A.

Artis  calculates  FFO  and  AFFO  payout  ratios  by  dividing  the  distributions  per  common  unit  (excluding  any  Special Distributions) by diluted FFO per unit and diluted AFFO per unit, respectively, over the same period.  Management uses the FFO and AFFO payout ratios to measure the REIT's ability to pay distributions.

In Q2-25, leasing costs included $6,530 in development costs for an office tenant in the Greater Phoenix Area, Arizona.

## Disposition

During Q2-25, Artis sold one retail property located in Canada for a sale price of $4,750. The sale proceeds, net of costs of $214 were $4,536.

## Investment properties held for sale

At  June  30,  2025,  the  REIT  had  one  retail  property  and  one  industrial  property  located  in  Canada,  and  three  industrial properties and two parcels of development land located in the U.S. with an aggregate fair value of $232,752, classified as held for sale. These properties were actively marketed for sale or under unconditional or conditional sale agreements at June 30, 2025.

## Foreign currency translation loss on investment properties

In Q2-25, the foreign currency translation loss on investment properties was $58,820 due to the change in the period end US dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate from 1.4376 at March 31, 2025 to 1.3643 at June 30, 2025.

## Fair value (loss) gain on investment properties

During Q2-25, the REIT recorded a loss on the fair value of investment properties of $7,958 (YTD - loss of $862), compared to a gain of $13,437 (YTD - gain of $12,437) in Q2-24. The fair value loss in Q2-25 was primarily due to increases in vacancy in select U.S. and Canadian office markets and lower expected market rents in the Twin Cities Area, Minnesota office market. This was partially  offset  by  a  fair  value  gain  due  to  capitalization  rate  compression  at  an  industrial  property  located  in  the  Greater Houston Area, Texas.

Artis determines the fair value of investment properties based upon either the discounted cash flow method or the overall capitalization method.  Capitalization rates are estimated using market surveys, available appraisals and market comparables. Under the overall capitalization method, year one income is stabilized and capitalized at a rate deemed appropriate for each investment property.  Individual properties were valued using capitalization rates in the range of 4.00% to 10.50%.

Additional information on the average capitalization rates and ranges used for the portfolio properties, assuming all properties were valued using an overall capitalization method, are set out in the following table.

## Preferred Investments

At June 30, 2025, the REIT had preferred investments of $105,697, compared to $139,881 at December 31, 2024.

During 2022, the REIT acquired junior preferred units in Iris Acquisition II LP ("Iris") for $100,000. The junior preferred units initially bore interest at a rate of 18% per annum until the third anniversary on March 1, 2025, at which time they bear interest at a rate of 24% per annum. Such interest is paid quarterly in cash or, at the election of Iris, in kind through the issuance of additional junior preferred units.  Refer to Other Investments section of this MD&amp;A for further details on investment in Iris.

As at June 30, 2025, the carrying value of the junior preferred units was $105,697, which reflects interest income received in the form of additional junior preferred units since initial investment, net of the allowance for expected credit loss.

The REIT has assessed that there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial investment and the investment in the junior preferred units is credit-impaired. The REIT recorded an incremental allowance for expected credit loss in the amount of $26,000  for  Q2-25  ($8,184  for  Q1-25  and  $31,316  for  Q4-24).  Since  December  2024,  there  have  been  discussions  with interested parties to acquire a portion or the entire portfolio of the investment properties of Iris with a solution to settle the outstanding  senior  and  junior  preferred  units  of  Iris  and  the  settlement  may  include  a  discount  to  the  senior  and  junior preferred  units.    These  discussions  are  ongoing,  and  management  expects  that  an  agreement  for  a  transaction  may  be reached within the next few months with terms that could result in the REIT recovering an amount in excess of the carrying value of the junior preferred units at June 30, 2025.  As more information becomes available, the REIT will adjust the allowance for expected credit loss as appropriate in future reporting periods.

The REIT's estimate is dependent on the ability of Iris to execute its plans and the possible results of a transaction with the unitholders of Iris.  Because these estimates are made at a specific point in time and are inherently subject to judgement and measurement uncertainty, such estimates could differ from actual results.

All of the REIT's cash is held in current accounts.

At June 30, 2025, variable rate mortgage debt (excluding swapped mortgages) as a percentage of total debt, including credit facilities  and  debentures  was  25.1%,  compared  to  25.5%  at  December  31,  2024.    Management  believes  that  holding  a percentage of variable rate debt is prudent in managing a portfolio of debt and provides the benefit of lower interest rates over the long term, while keeping the overall risk at a moderate level.  All of the REIT's variable rate mortgage debt is term debt and cannot be called on demand.  The REIT has the ability to refinance, or use interest rate swaps, at any given point without incurring penalties.

## Senior Unsecured Debentures

During Q2-25, Artis repaid the Series E senior unsecured debentures upon maturity with a face value of $200,000. As at June 30, 2025, there were no senior unsecured debentures outstanding.

## Credit Facilities

On  December  11,  2024,  the  REIT  entered  into  an  agreement  for  senior  secured  credit  facilities  (ie.  the  Secured  Credit Facilities)  for  an  aggregate  amount  of  $520,000,  which  include  the  $350,000  revolving  credit  facility  and  the  $170,000  nonrevolving credit facility.  The Secured Credit Facilities mature on December 10, 2027 and can be utilized for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition or development of additional income producing properties.  The REIT can draw on the Secured Credit Facilities in Canadian or US dollars.  The Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at rates which depend on the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated gross book value.  At June 30, 2025, the interest rate on Canadian dollar advances was adjusted CORRA + 2.10% or prime + 1.10%,  and the interest rate on US dollar advances was adjusted SOFR + 2.10% or US base rate + 1.10%.

For purposes of the Secured Credit Facilities, the REIT must maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated gross book value ratio of not more than 60%, a minimum consolidated EBITDA to debt service ratio of 1.40, a minimum unitholders' equity of not less than the sum of $750,000 and 75% of net proceeds received in connection with any equity offerings made after the date of the credit facilities agreement.  As at June 30, 2025, the REIT was in compliance with these requirements.

As at June 30, 2025, there was $271,600 drawn on the revolving credit facility and $170,000 drawn on the non-revolving credit facility (December 31, 2024, $85,000 drawn on the revolving credit facility and $170,000 drawn on the non-revolving facility).

## Accounts Payable &amp; Other Liabilities

Included in accounts payable and other liabilities was accrued distributions payable to unitholders of $6,105, which were paid subsequent to June 30, 2025.

## UNITHOLDERS' EQUITY

Unitholders' equity decreased overall by $124,992 between December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.  The overall decrease was primarily due to other comprehensive loss of $47,597, distributions made to unitholders of $35,949, $54,592 of common units and $2,523 of preferred units purchased through the NCIB, net loss of $12,065, and unit buyback tax of $535, partially offset by contributed surplus of $28,255, and the issuance of common units of $14.

## OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES

The measures and ratios calculated below are non-GAAP.  Refer to the Notice with Respect to Non-GAAP &amp; Supplementary Measures Disclosure section of this MD&amp;A.

## NAV per Unit

NAV per unit is a non-GAAP measure.  Artis calculates NAV per unit as its unitholders' equity, adjusted for the outstanding face value of its preferred units, divided by its total number of dilutive units outstanding.

Management considers this metric to be a valuable measure of the REIT's residual equity available to its common unitholders.

The face value of preferred equity decreased due to preferred units purchased under the NCIB.

The total number of dilutive units outstanding has decreased primarily due to units purchased under the NCIB.

## Total Debt to GBV

Total debt to GBV is a non-GAAP measure.  Artis calculates GBV based on the total consolidated assets of the REIT, adding back the amount of accumulated depreciation of property and equipment.   Artis calculates total debt to GBV by dividing total debt, which consists of mortgages and loans, the carrying value of senior unsecured debentures, credit facilities and preferred shares liability, by GBV.

Management considers total debt to GBV to be a valuable measure of the REIT's leverage.  Under the terms of the REIT's Declaration of Trust, total indebtedness of the REIT is limited to 70% of GBV.

## Adjusted EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio

Adjusted  EBITDA  interest  coverage  ratio  is  a  non-GAAP  measure.    The  REIT  calculates  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  net  income, adjusted for interest expense, income taxes, all non-cash revenue and expense items and non-recurring items. The REIT also deducts net income (loss) from equity accounted investments and adds distributions from equity accounted investments.

In  Q2-25,  the  REIT  recorded  an  expected  credit  loss  on  the  investments  in  the  preferred  units  of  Iris  (Refer  to  Preferred Investments section of this MD&amp;A for further details).  The expected credit loss was added back to the calculation of EBITDA due to its non-recurring and non-cash nature.

Adjusted  EBITDA  interest  coverage  ratio  is  calculated  by  dividing  Adjusted  EBITDA  by  interest  expense  from  operations (excluding amortization of financing costs and above- and below-market mortgage adjustments) and excludes the REIT's share of interest expense in equity accounted investments.

Management  considers  this  ratio  to  be  a  valuable  measure  of  Artis's  ability  to  service  the  interest  requirements  on  its outstanding debt.

## Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA

Total debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Artis calculates total debt to Adjusted EBITDA based on annualizing the  current  quarter's  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  defined  above  and  comparing  that  balance  to  Artis's  total  outstanding  debt. Management considers this ratio to be a valuable measure of Artis's ability to meet financial obligations.

## OTHER INVESTMENTS

The REIT has interests in the following other investments held in equity accounted investments:

|                        |                 |                                                                | Ownership Interest   | Ownership Interest   |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Investment             | Investment Type | Purpose                                                        | June 30, 2025        | December 31, 2024    |
| ICE LP                 | Joint venture   | Investment in Iris Acquisition II LP                           | 50.00%               | 50.00%               |
| ICE II LP              | Joint venture   | Investment in the asset manager of Iris Acquisition II LP      | 50.00%               | 50.00%               |
| Iris Acquisition II LP | Associate       | Investment in Cominar Real Estate Investment Trust ("Cominar") | 32.29%               | 32.29%               |

In  2022,  the  REIT  contributed  $112,000 to acquire common equity units in Iris Acquisition II LP ("Iris"), an entity formed to acquire the outstanding units of Cominar. The REIT's investment in 32.64% of the outstanding common equity units of Iris is determined to be an investment in an associate on the basis of the REIT's significant influence over this investment through representation  on  the  Board  of  Cominar  and  the  Board  of  the  ultimate  general  partner  of  Iris.  During  the  year  ended December 31, 2024, Iris issued additional common equity units under its long-term incentive plan, resulting in the dilution of the REIT's interest to 32.29%.

In connection with the investment in Iris, the REIT, Sandpiper and an affiliate of Sandpiper entered into two joint ventures, ICE LP and ICE II LP.  ICE LP holds 33.33% interest in the ultimate general partner of Iris and certain equity interest in Iris with profit participation rights.  ICE II LP holds 33.33% interest in the asset manager of Cominar.

Under the asset management agreement, the asset manager earns a monthly fee of 1/12th of 1.75% of the net asset value of Iris.  The asset management agreement has an initial term of six years with an automatic renewal of one year thereafter.

In addition, the REIT has an investment in junior preferred units of Iris in the initial amount of $100,000.  Refer to Preferred Investments section of this MD&amp;A for further details.

The change in other investments held in equity accounted investments is a result of the following:

| Balance, December 31, 2024   | $ 565   |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Distributions from ICE II LP | (550)   |
| Balance, March 31, 2025      | $ 15    |
| Distributions from ICE II LP | -       |
| Balance, June 30, 2025       | $ 15    |

As at June 30, 2025, the REIT's cumulative share of losses of Iris exceeded the REIT's net investment in the common equity units.    As  a  result,  the  loss  from  Iris  in  the  amount  of  $18,348  (YTD  -  $42,538)  was  not  recognized  in  Q2-25,  compared  to $17,845 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as the REIT has no obligation in respect of these losses.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flow from operations represents the primary source of funds for distributions to unitholders and principal repayments on mortgages and loans.

## DISTRIBUTIONS

The Trustees determine the level of cash distributions based on the level of cash flow from operations before working capital changes, less actual and planned capital expenditures.  During the period, distributions are based on estimates of full year cash flow and capital spending; thus, distributions may be adjusted as these estimates change.  It is expected that normal seasonal fluctuations in working capital will be funded from cash resources.

| Shortfall of net income (loss) over distributions paid and payable                  | (41,315)                           | (48,014)                         | (123,113)                      | (411,526)                      |

Artis's primary objective is to provide tax-efficient monthly cash distributions.

The shortfall of cash flow from operations over distributions paid and payable for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was primarily due to variations in timing of cash flows related to working capital items.

The shortfall of net income (loss) over distributions paid and payable for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2025, the year ended December 31, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the non-cash impact of the fair value changes on investment properties and financial instruments. Also contributing to the shortfall of net income (loss) over distributions paid and payable for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024, was the non-cash impact of the e xpected credit loss on preferred investments.

## CAPITAL RESOURCES

At June 30, 2025, Artis had $16,639 of cash on hand.  Management anticipates that the cash on hand may be invested in investment properties, used for working capital purposes, debt repayment or other activities in accordance with the REIT's business strategy.

The REIT has a secured revolving term credit facility in the amount of $350,000, which can be utilized for general corporate and working capital purposes, short term financing of investment property acquisitions and the issuance of letters of credit.  At June 30, 2025, the REIT had $78,400 available on its revolving term credit facilities.  Under the terms of the senior secured credit facilities agreement, the borrowing capacity is limited by an amount determined based on the calculated lending value of  the  secured  properties  (as  defined  in  the  agreement).    As  at  June  30,  2025,  the  total  borrowing  capacity  of  the  credit facilities, including both the non-revolving and revolving facilities, was limited to $514,536 (December 31, 2024, not limited).

At  June  30,  2025,  the  REIT  had  9  unencumbered  properties  and  two  unencumbered  parcels  of  development  land, representing a fair value of $205,764.

Artis is not in default or arrears on any of its obligations, including distributions to unitholders, interest or principal payments on debt at June 30, 2025.

The REIT's mortgage providers have various financial covenants.  The REIT monitors these covenants, which are primarily debt service coverage ratios. Mortgages and loans payable with maturities within 12 months or are payable on demand as a result of a financial covenant breach are classified as current liabilities.

The REIT's management expects to meet all of its short-term obligations and capital commitments with respect to investment properties  and  new  developments  in  process  through  funds  generated  from  operations,  from  the  proceeds  of  mortgage financing, drawing on secured credit facilities, from the issuance of new debentures or units and from cash on hand.

As  at  June  30,  2025,  the  REIT  had  an  extension  option  for  a  mortgage  maturing  in  the  next  12  months  in  the  amount  of $44,323.

## RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

A summary of all risks applicable to the REIT are set forth in Artis's 2024 Annual Information Form. The REIT discusses specific risk factors below.

## STRATEGY

## Failure to Execute the Strategy

Pursuant to the strategy, Artis intends to make investments that achieve superior investment performance commensurate with reasonable risk. This goal relies on the successful execution of its investment strategies, which may be uncertain as it requires suitable  opportunities,  careful  timing  and  business  judgment,  as  well  as  sufficient  resources  to  make  investments  and restructure them, if required, notwithstanding difficulties experienced in a particular industry. In addition, there is no assurance that  Artis  will  be  able  to  identify  suitable  or  sufficient  opportunities  that  meet  its  investment  criteria  and  be  able  to  make investments  at  attractive  prices  to  supplement  its  growth  in  a  timely  manner,  or  at  all.  Further,  Artis  may  be  exposed  to unexpected risks and costs associated with its investments, including that the costs necessary to bring an investment up to Artis's standards established for its intended market position may be higher than expected.

## Investment Portfolio

In connection with the strategy, investment returns will become an increasingly important part of Artis's overall profitability as Artis's  operating  results  will  depend  in  part  on  the  performance  of  its  investment  portfolio.  It  is  expected  that  Artis's investment portfolio will include bond and other debt instruments, common stock, preferred stock and derivative instruments. Accordingly, fluctuations in  the  fixed  income  or  equity  markets  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  Artis's  financial  condition, profitability or cash flows. The return on the portfolio and the risks associated with the investments are affected by the asset mix of the portfolio companies, which can change materially depending on market conditions.

## Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Initiatives

Pursuant to the strategy, Artis may periodically explore opportunities to make strategic investments in all or part of certain businesses or companies. Although Artis will undertake due diligence prior to the completion of an acquisition or investment, there can be no assurance that Artis will have adequate time or access to complete appropriate investigations or that Artis will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risks of such investment. Furthermore, some of the risks may be outside of Artis's control and leave Artis with no ability to mitigate or control the chances that those risks will adversely impact the target company. In addition, there is no assurance that the anticipated financial or strategic objectives following an integration effort or  the  implementation  of  a  strategic  initiative  will  be  achieved,  which  could  adversely  affect  Artis's  financial  condition, profitability  or  cash  flows.  In  particular,  acquisitions  may  involve  a  number  of  special  risks,  including  failure  to  retain  key personnel, unanticipated events or circumstances and legal liabilities, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on Artis's business, results of operations and financial position.

## Control or Significant Influence Risk &amp; Minority Investments

Although  Artis  may  endeavour  to  make  investments  that  allow  it  to  acquire  control  or  exercise  significant  influence  over management and the strategic direction of its portfolio entities, there can be no assurance that all investments will provide Artis  with  such  a  degree  of  influence  or  control.  In  addition,  the  exercise  of  control  over  a  portfolio  company  imposes additional risks of liability for failure to supervise management. The exercise of control over an investment could expose the assets of Artis to claims by such businesses, its shareholders and its creditors. While Artis intends to manage its investments in a manner that will minimize the exposure to these risks, the possibility of successful claims cannot be precluded. On occasion, Artis  expects  that  it  may  also  make  minority  equity  investments  in  businesses  in  which  Artis  does  not  participate  in  the management or otherwise control the business or affairs of such businesses. While Artis will monitor the performance of each investment  and  maintain  an  ongoing  dialogue  with  each  business  management  team,  it  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the management of the business to operate the business on a day-to-day basis and Artis may not have the right or ability to control  or  otherwise  influence  such  business.  Accordingly,  these  companies  may  undertake  activities  which  Artis  does  not believe is in their best interests.

## Competitive Market for Investment Opportunities

In accordance with the overall strategy and Artis's business objective and investment strategies, Artis will compete with a large number of other investors, such as private equity funds, mezzanine funds, investment banks and other equity and non-equity based public and private investment funds, and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies, such as commercial banks. Competitors may have a lower cost of funds and may have access to funding sources that are not available to Artis. In addition, certain competitors of Artis may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and build their respective market shares. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures faced by Artis will not have a material adverse effect on its investment activities pursuant to the strategy.

## Reputation

Artis could be negatively impacted if there is misconduct or alleged misconduct by its personnel, personnel of Sandpiper or those of the portfolio companies in which Artis invests, including historical misconduct prior to its investment. Risks associated with misconduct at portfolio companies is heightened in cases where Artis does not have legal control or exercise significant influence over an investment, or is not otherwise involved in actively managing a portfolio company. In such situations, given Artis's ownership position and affiliation with the portfolio company, it may still be negatively impacted from a reputational perspective through this association.

## Reliance on Services of Sandpiper

Some decisions with respect to the assets and investment strategy of Artis are expected to be made with reliance on the services and support of Sandpiper. Personnel and support staff of Sandpiper who provide services to Artis are not required to treat their responsibilities to Artis as their primary responsibilities or to act exclusively for Artis (other than Samir Manji, who has certain fiduciary duties and contractual obligations with respect to Artis in his capacity as CEO and a trustee). The Services Agreement does not require Sandpiper to maintain the employment of any of its personnel or to cause any particular person to provide services to Artis. There can be no assurance that any of the personnel and support staff of Sandpiper will remain in their current positions.

## REAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

All  real  property  investments  are  subject  to  elements  of  risk.  General  economic  and  political  conditions,  local  real  estate markets, supply and demand for leased premises, competition from other available premises and various other factors affect such  investments.  The  value  of  real  property  and  any  improvements  thereto  may  also  depend  on  the  credit  and  financial stability  of  the  tenants  and  upon  vacancy  rates  of  Artis's  portfolio  of  income-producing  properties.  Artis's  financial performance would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants were to become unable to meet their obligations under their leases.  Upon the expiry of any lease, there can be no assurance that the lease will be renewed on favourable terms to Artis or at all and no guarantee that the tenant can be replaced. The terms of any subsequent leases may be less favourable to Artis than the existing leases. In the event of default by a tenant, delays or limitations in enforcing rights as lessor may be experienced and substantial costs may be incurred by Artis. Furthermore, at any time, a tenant of any of Artis's property or properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws that could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant's lease and thereby adversely affect the financial performance of Artis.

Certain expenditures, including property taxes, maintenance costs, mortgage payments, insurance costs and related charges must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property regardless of whether the real property is producing any income.  If  Artis  is  unable  to  make  mortgage  payments  on  any  property,  losses  could  be  sustained  as  a  result  of  the mortgagee's exercise of its right of foreclosure and sale.

## DEVELOPMENTS

Artis is subject to numerous risks related to development projects including development costs exceeding original estimates, construction or other unforeseen timing delays and development projects not be leased on a timely basis or at anticipated rates upon completion.  These risks could impact the REIT's liquidity, financial position and future earning potential.

At June 30, 2025, there were no investment properties under development.

## DEBT FINANCING AND INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS

Artis will be subject to the risks associated with debt financing.  There can be no assurance that Artis will be able to refinance its existing indebtedness on terms that are as or more favourable to Artis as the terms of existing indebtedness.  The inability to replace financing of debt on maturity would have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of Artis.

Management seeks to mitigate this risk in a variety of ways.  First, management considers structuring the timing of the renewal of significant tenant leases on properties in relation to the time at which mortgage indebtedness on such property becomes due for refinancing.  Second, management seeks to secure financing from a variety of lenders on a property by property basis. Third, mortgage terms are, where practical, structured such that the exposure in any one year to financing risks is balanced.

Artis is also subject to interest rate risk associated with the REIT's credit facilities and mortgages payable due to the expected requirement to refinance such debts in the year of maturity.  The REIT minimizes the risk by restricting debt to 70% of gross book value and by carefully monitoring the amount of variable rate debt.  At June 30, 2025, 26.2% of the REIT's mortgages and loans payable bear interest at fixed rates, and a further 31.5% of the REIT's mortgages and loans payable bear interest at variable  rates  with  interest  rate  swaps  in  place.    At  June  30,  2025,  the  REIT  is  a  party  to  $916,298  of  variable  rate  debt, including credit facilities (December 31, 2024, $748,707).  At June 30, 2025, the REIT had entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with $202,813 of variable rate debt (December 31, 2024, $203,020).  The REIT has the ability to place interest rate swaps on top of variable rate debt at any time in order to effectively fix the interest rate.

At June 30, 2025, the REIT's ratio of total debt to GBV was 41.1%, compared to 40.2% at December 31, 2024.  Approximately 38.0%  of  Artis's  maturing  mortgage  debt  comes  up  for  renewal  during  the  remainder  of  2025,  and  29.1%  in  2026. Management is in discussion with various lenders with respect to the renewal or refinancing of the remainder of the 2025 mortgage maturities.

## FOREIGN CURRENCY

The REIT owns properties located in the U.S.,  and  therefore,  the  REIT  is  subject  to  foreign  currency  fluctuations  that  may impact its financial position and results.  In order to mitigate this risk, the REIT's debt on U.S. properties and when applicable, a portion of the amounts drawn on credit facilities are held in US dollars to act as a natural hedge.

## TENANTS

## Credit and Tenant Concentration

Artis is exposed to risks relating to tenants that may be unable to pay their contracted rents.  Management mitigates this risk by acquiring and owning properties across several asset classes and geographical regions.  As well, management seeks to acquire properties with strong tenant covenants in place.  Artis's portfolio includes 663 tenant leases with a weighted-average term  to  maturity  of  5.0  years.    Approximately  46.1%  of  the  REIT's  gross  revenue  is  derived  from  national  or  government tenants.  As indicated below, the REIT's largest tenant by gross revenue is the government (including federal, provincial or state,  civic  or  municipal  government  tenants).    Further  information  regarding  the  REIT's  government  tenants  can  be  found below under Government Tenants by Gross Revenue.  The second largest tenant by gross revenue is Bell Canada, one of Canada's leading telecommunications companies.

## Lease Rollover

The value of investment properties and the stability of cash flows derived from those properties is dependent upon the level of occupancy and lease rates in those properties.  Upon expiry of any lease, there is no assurance that a lease will be renewed on favourable terms, or at all; nor is there any assurance that a tenant can be replaced.  A contraction in the Canadian or U.S. economy would negatively impact demand for space in industrial, office and retail properties, consequently increasing the risk that leases expiring in the near term will not be renewed.

Details of the portfolio's expiry schedule is as follows:

|                 | Canada     | Canada   | Canada   | U.S.       | U.S.   |        |
|-----------------|------------|----------|----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Expiry Year     | Industrial | Office   | Retail   | Industrial | Office | Total  |
| 2025            | 2.0%       | 1.6%     | 0.5%     | 1.0%       | 2.6%   | 7.7%   |

Artis's real estate is diversified across four Canadian provinces and four U.S. states, and across the industrial, office, retail and residential  asset  classes.    By  city  and  asset  class,  the  five  largest  markets  of  the  REIT's  portfolio  (by  Q2-25  net  operating income) are Twin Cities Area Office, Madison Office, Greater Phoenix Area Office, Winnipeg Office and Winnipeg Industrial.

## SIFT RULES AND OTHER TAX-RELATED FACTORS

The Income Tax Act (Canada) contains legislation affecting the tax treatment of a SIFT trust or partnership ("the SIFT Rules"), which are applicable to publicly traded income trusts unless the trust satisfies the REIT Exception. The REIT Exception to the SIFT Rules is comprised of a number of technical tests and the determination as to whether the REIT qualifies for the REIT Exception in any particular taxation year can only be made with certainty at the end of the taxation year. Management believes that the REIT has met the requirements of the REIT Exception in each taxation year since 2009 and that it has met the REIT Exception throughout the period ended June 30, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024.  There can be no assurances, however, that the REIT will continue to be able to satisfy the REIT Exception in the future such that the REIT will not be subject to the tax imposed by the SIFT Rules.

If  Artis is subject to the SIFT Rules, the SIFT Rules may, depending on the nature of distributions from Artis, including what portion of its distributions are income and what portion are returns of capital, have a material adverse effect on the after-tax returns of certain Unitholders.

Also, in the event that the SIFT Rules apply to Artis, they may adversely affect the marketability of the Units or Preferred Units, the amount of cash available for distributions and, among other things, there can be no assurance that Artis will be able to maintain the portion of distributions that is treated as a non-taxable return of capital.

The Tax Act contains restrictions relating to the activities and the investments permitted by a mutual fund trust. Closed-end trusts must also comply with a number of technical tests relating to its investments and income.

Management of Artis  intends  to  ensure  that  Artis  satisfies  the  conditions  to  qualify  as  a  closed-end  mutual  fund  trust  by complying  with  the  restrictions  in  the  Tax  Act  as  they  are  interpreted  and  applied  by  the  Canada  Revenue  Agency.  No assurance can be given that Artis will be able to comply with these restrictions at all times. If Artis were not to qualify as a mutual fund trust, the consequences could be material and adverse.

There can be no assurance that the Canadian federal income tax laws respecting mutual fund trusts, or the ways in which these rules are interpreted and applied by the Canada Revenue Agency, may not be changed in a manner which adversely affect Artis and/or its security holders.

Recent amendments to the Tax Act contains excessive interest and financing expenses limitation ('EIFEL') rules that applies to trusts and corporations effective January 1, 2024.  The EIFEL rules limit the amount of net interest and financing expenses in certain circumstances to a fixed ratio of 30% of tax-EBITDA. Where a consolidated group is eligible and elects as a group, a higher group ratio can be used.  Management believes that the EIFEL Rules did not have an adverse impact on the REIT and its subsidiaries for the period ended June 30, 2025 and year ended December 31, 2024, however, there can be no assurances in this regard for future years. If the EIFEL Rules were to apply to restrict deductions otherwise available to the REIT and/or its subsidiaries, the taxable income allocated by the REIT to Unitholders may increase, which would reduce the after-tax return for investors.

The REIT operates in the U.S. through four U.S. REITs (Artis US Holdings, Inc., Artis US Holdings II, LLC, Artis US Holdings III, LLC and Artis US Holdings IV, LLC) which are primarily capitalized by the REIT by way of common equity, debt in the form of notes owed to the REIT and preferred shares. If the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') or a court were to determine that the notes and related interest should be treated differently for tax purposes this may adversely affect the REIT's ability to flow income from the U.S. to Canada.

## CYBER SECURITY

Cyber security  has  become  an  increasingly  problematic  issue  for  issuers  and  businesses  in  Canada  and  around  the  world, including for Artis and the real estate industry. Cyber attacks against large organizations are increasing in sophistication and are often focused on financial fraud, compromising sensitive data for inappropriate use or disrupting business operations. A cyber  incident  is  considered  to  be  any  adverse  event  that  threatens  the  confidentiality,  integrity  or  availability  of  the organization's information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can  include  gaining  unauthorized  access  to  information  systems  to  disrupt  operations,  corrupt  data  or  steal  confidential information.

As Artis's reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its system. Artis's primary risks that could directly result  from  the  occurrence  of  a  cyber  incident  include  operational  interruption,  damage  to  its  reputation,  damage  to  its business relationships with its tenants, disclosure of confidential information regarding its tenants, employees and third parties with who Artis interacts, and may result in negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation. These developments may subject Artis's operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs,  and,  depending on their magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on Artis's financial position and results of operations.

The Board and management are responsible for overseeing Artis's cyber security risks. To remain resilient to these risks, Artis has implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks, including installing firewalls and antivirus programs  on  its  networks,  servers  and  computers,  and  staff  training.  However,  these  measures,  as  well  as  its  increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not provide assurance that its efforts will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging.

## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The policies that the REIT's management believes are the most subject to estimation and judgment are set out in the REIT's Management Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2024.

## CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The REIT's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  IFRS  Accounting Standards.  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.

All control systems have inherent limitations, and evaluation of a control system cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected, including risks of misstatement due to error or fraud. Management anticipates that the REIT will be continually evolving and enhancing its systems of controls and procedures.

The Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") evaluated, or caused to be evaluated under their supervision, the effectiveness of the REIT's internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in NI 52-109).  Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as at June 30, 2025, the design of the REIT's internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.  No changes were made in the REIT's design of internal controls over financial reporting during the six months ended June 30, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the REIT's internal controls over financial reporting.

## DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The REIT's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the REIT is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under Canadian securities  laws,  and  include  controls  and  procedures  that  are  designed  to  ensure  that  information  is  accumulated  and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As of June 30, 2025, under the supervision of the CEO and CFO and with the participation of management, the effectiveness of the REIT's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in NI 52-109) was evaluated.  Based on the evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the REIT's designed disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the six months ended June 30, 2025.
