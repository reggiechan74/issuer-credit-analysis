## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

Dream Industrial REIT presents a **BBB (mid)** credit profile characterized by strong operational fundamentals offset by critical short-term liquidity constraints. With debt/assets of 26.8% and interest coverage of 4.77x, the REIT demonstrates investment-grade leverage metrics consistent with its DBRS BBB rating. However, the aggressive growth strategy has created a **CRITICAL liquidity situation** with only 0.9 months of cash runway on available cash alone, necessitating immediate reliance on the $672M undrawn credit facility.

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** BBB (mid)

**Key Credit Story:**

Dream Industrial REIT is a growth-oriented, diversified industrial REIT operating 338 assets (72.9M SF) across Canada, Europe, and the U.S. The REIT has successfully executed a capital deployment strategy with $543M in acquisitions YTD 2025, achieving strong operational performance (5.0% CP NOI growth, 96.0% occupancy) and substantial rent spreads (20.0% weighted average on recent leasing). However, this growth-first strategy has consumed cash reserves, creating negative AFCF of -$73.5M and a self-funding ratio of -0.33x. The REIT must access capital markets for debt refinancing and distribution funding, creating refinancing risk during market stress. The subsequent $200M Series G debenture issuance (closed post-Q2) partially addresses 2025 maturities but underscores ongoing capital market dependency. The credit profile hinges on maintaining access to capital markets and executing $100M+ of planned asset dispositions.

**Critical Ratings Drivers:**
1. **Strong portfolio quality** - 96% occupancy, 4.3-year WALT, 22.9% rent upside in Canada
2. **Conservative leverage** - 26.8% debt/assets vs 36-48% peer range; well below BBB threshold
3. **Critical liquidity position** - Negative AFCF requires continuous capital market access
4. **Diversified scale** - $8.3B assets, 338 properties, 72.9M SF across 3 continents

- **Rent Upside: 22.9% in Canada, 4.6% in Europe** - Substantial mark-to-market opportunity as leases roll
- **Leasing Momentum: 3.3M SF at 20.0% spread** (Q2-July 2025) - Strong demand for well-located urban industrial assets

### ✓ Diversified Global Platform with Vertically Integrated Operations
- **Geographic Diversification:** Canada (primary), Europe (secondary), U.S. (JV exposure via Dream Summit JV and U.S. Fund)
- **Scale: 338 assets, 72.9M SF** across key industrial markets - Critical mass to drive economies of scale
- **Property Management Platform:** $6.1M net margin in H1 2025 (+20.1% YoY) from third-party ventures - Recurring fee income diversifies revenue
- **Development Pipeline:** 180 acres of excess land with 3M SF potential at >8% target yield - Organic NAV growth opportunity

## Credit Challenges

### ⚠️ CRITICAL Liquidity Position and Negative Free Cash Flow
- **Available Cash: $42.6M** - Represents only **0.9 months** of cash runway at current burn rate
- **AFCF: -$73.5M** (H1 2025) - Operations cannot self-fund growth, debt service, and distributions
- **Self-Funding Ratio: -0.33x** - Can only cover 33% of financing needs (debt service + distributions) from free cash flow
- **Monthly Burn Rate: -$49.5K/month** despite positive operations - Growth capital deployment exceeds operating cash flow generation
- **Extended Runway: 14.4 months** including $672M undrawn credit facility - Adequate but requires disciplined capital allocation

**Mitigation:** Total available liquidity of $714.4M ($42.6M cash + $671.8M undrawn facility + $250M accordion option) provides buffer. Post-Q2 $200M debenture issuance addresses near-term refinancing needs. Planned $100M asset sales will improve liquidity.

### ⚠️ Capital Market Dependency for Debt Refinancing and Distribution Coverage
- **Debt Maturities:** ~70% of 2025 maturities addressed as of Q2; remaining ~30% requires refinancing or asset sales
- **AFCF Distribution Coverage: -0.74x** - Distributions ($99.6M annualized) exceed free cash flow, requiring external financing or distribution cut
- **Growth Strategy Reliance on Capital Markets:** $543M acquisitions YTD 2025 funded via credit facility draws and subsequent debt issuance
- **Refinancing Risk:** During market stress or credit spread widening, REIT may face higher financing costs or limited market access

**Credit Implication:** BBB-rated REITs typically maintain AFCF distribution coverage >1.0x. Dream Industrial's negative coverage indicates aggressive capital deployment that prioritizes growth over self-funding sustainability.

### ⚠️ FFO Calculation Variance and Methodology Differences
- **FFO Variance: -13.0%** (reported $149.4M vs. calculated $130.1M using REALPAC methodology)
- **Variance exceeds 5% threshold** - Suggests potential differences in adjustment treatment (e.g., transaction costs, JV accounting, FX gains/losses)
- **AFFO Not Reported by Issuer** - Limits visibility into sustainable operating cash flow after sustaining capital expenditures
- **ACFO Calculated: $221.3M** but not disclosed by issuer - REALPAC-calculated ACFO suggests stronger operating cash flow than reported FFO implies

**Analytical Concern:** Material FFO variance requires reconciliation to ensure consistent peer comparison. The -13% variance (larger than typical 2-3% rounding differences) may stem from:
- Treatment of JV distributions ($17.1M) - REALPAC includes actual distributions received
- Transaction costs ($3.6M) - REALPAC adds back acquisition-related costs
- Foreign exchange gains/losses ($2.1M) - REALPAC adjusts for unrealized FX movements
- Incremental leasing costs ($3.0M) - Timing differences in capitalization vs. expense

**Recommendation:** Request management reconciliation of reported vs. REALPAC FFO to clarify methodology.

### ⚠️ Aggressive Growth Strategy Creates Execution Risk
- **$543M Acquisitions in H1 2025** ($460M via Dream Summit JV + $83M wholly-owned) - Significant capital deployment
- **Development CAPEX: $38.1M** in H1 2025 - Growth capital diverts cash from debt reduction
- **JV Capital Contributions: $37.0M** - Additional growth investments in private ventures
- **NCIB Unit Buybacks: $20.0M** (1.9M units at $10.42 average) - Opportunistic but consumes liquidity
- **Net Disposal Proceeds: Only $11.4M** - Asset recycling has not yet meaningfully funded growth

**Risk:** If industrial fundamentals deteriorate (e.g., supply glut, demand slowdown, rent compression), recent acquisitions may not achieve targeted returns, pressuring NOI growth and debt servicing capacity.

---

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

### Outlook: STABLE with downside bias if liquidity not improved

**Justification:**

The **STABLE** outlook reflects Dream Industrial's strong underlying portfolio fundamentals (96% occupancy, 4.1% NOI growth, substantial rent upside) and conservative leverage (26.8% debt/assets) that provide a solid foundation for the BBB rating. The REIT's ability to access unsecured debt markets (evidenced by the $200M Series G issuance) and maintain its DBRS BBB rating demonstrates continued lender confidence.

However, the outlook carries **downside bias** due to:

1. **CRITICAL Cash Position:** 0.9-month runway on available cash alone necessitates immediate credit facility reliance. Any disruption to credit facility availability (e.g., covenant breach, lender pullback) would create acute stress.

2. **Negative Free Cash Flow:** AFCF of -$73.5M and self-funding ratio of -0.33x indicate operations cannot sustain current distribution levels and growth investments without continuous capital market access. A market dislocation (credit spread widening, equity market closure) would force distribution cuts or asset sales at potentially unfavorable pricing.

3. **Execution Risk on Asset Dispositions:** Management targets $100M of dispositions, but only $11.4M realized in H1 2025. Failure to execute planned asset sales at expected pricing would prolong liquidity constraints.

4. **Rising Interest Rates:** Weighted average face rate increased from 2.47% to 2.77% in Q2 2025. Continued rate increases will compress coverage ratios and increase refinancing costs for upcoming maturities.

**Positive Catalysts** that could shift outlook to POSITIVE:
- Successful execution of $100M+ asset disposition program with proceeds directed to debt reduction or liquidity enhancement
- AFCF improvement to positive territory through reduced growth capex or increased operating cash flow
- Distribution payout ratio reduction from 68.9% to <65%, creating cash flow cushion
- NOI growth acceleration from rent upside realization, improving coverage metrics

**Base Case Scenario:** REIT maintains BBB rating by successfully refinancing remaining 2025 maturities, executing targeted asset sales, and maintaining leverage <30% debt/assets through disciplined capital allocation. Distribution policy remains unchanged but AFCF gradually improves as development projects stabilize.

**Stabilization Criteria:** Not specified

---

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

Dream Industrial REIT could be upgraded to **BBB (high)** or **A (low)** if the following conditions are met:

### Quantitative Thresholds (All Criteria Required):

| Metric | Current | Upgrade Threshold | Improvement Required |
|--------|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | 26.8% | <25% (sustained) | -1.8 ppt deleveraging |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | 4.77x | >5.5x (sustained) | +15% coverage improvement |
| **AFCF Self-Funding Ratio** | -0.33x | >1.2x | Positive AFCF + 20% cushion |
| **Cash Runway (Available Cash)** | 0.9 months | >6 months | $250M+ cash accumulation |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | N/A (not reported) | <60% (if reported) | Distribution discipline |

### Qualitative Improvements:

1. **Transition to Self-Funding Model:**
   - AFCF consistently positive for 4+ consecutive quarters
   - Distribution coverage from AFCF >1.2x (20% cushion above distributions)
   - Reduced reliance on capital markets for distribution funding

2. **Balance Sheet Optimization:**
   - Debt/assets sustained below 25% for 8+ quarters
   - Liquidity buildup to $200M+ cash on balance sheet
   - All near-term maturities (2-year horizon) pre-funded or termed out

3. **Portfolio Performance Excellence:**
   - Occupancy sustained >97% for 8+ consecutive quarters
   - Same property NOI growth >5% for 4+ consecutive quarters
   - Rent spread realization driving FFO/unit CAGR >6%

4. **Scale and Diversification Enhancement:**
   - Asset base expansion to $10B+ total assets
   - Geographic diversification with no single market >50% of NOI
   - Third-party fee income scaling to $15M+ annually

5. **Financial Policy Evolution:**
   - Adopt and publish AFFO metric with payout ratio target <65%
   - Formal leverage target of 25% debt/assets (midpoint of range)
   - Commitment to pre-funding debt maturities 12+ months in advance

**Upgrade Catalyst Scenario:**

Dream Industrial executes $250M of asset dispositions at >105% of IFRS value, applies proceeds to debt reduction (debt/assets falls to 23%), builds cash reserves to $150M, and suspends acquisitions for 12 months to allow AFCF to turn positive. Occupancy remains >97%, and rent upside realization drives NOI/interest coverage to 5.8x. REIT publishes AFFO payout ratio of 58%, demonstrating distribution sustainability. **Result: Upgrade to BBB (high) or A (low).**

---

---

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

Dream Industrial REIT could be downgraded to **BBB (low)** or **BB (high)** if the following adverse developments occur:

### Quantitative Triggers (Any Single Trigger):

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer to Trigger |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | >35% | 26.8% | 8.2 ppt cushion |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | <3.5x | 4.77x | -27% deterioration allowed |
| **Cash Runway (Extended)** | <6 months | 14.4 months | -58% liquidity drawdown |
| **Occupancy Rate** | <90% (sustained) | 96.0% | -600 bps leasing deterioration |
| **AFCF Self-Funding Ratio** | <-0.75x | -0.33x | -55% further deterioration |

### Qualitative Downgrade Scenarios:

1. **Liquidity Crisis:**
   - Credit facility covenant breach (e.g., debt service coverage falls below bank requirements)
   - Inability to refinance maturing debt within 90 days of maturity
   - Forced asset sales at >10% discount to IFRS value to raise liquidity
   - Distribution suspension due to cash flow insufficiency

2. **Operating Deterioration:**
   - Occupancy decline to <92% for 2+ consecutive quarters
   - Same property NOI decline (negative growth) for 2+ consecutive quarters
   - Major tenant default (>5% of NOI) without replacement tenant identified
   - Failure to achieve expected returns on recent $543M acquisition program

3. **Leverage Expansion:**
   - Debt/assets increases to >32% through asset value declines or additional borrowings
   - Secured debt increases to >20% of total debt (from current 14.1%)
   - Loss of access to unsecured debt markets, forcing reliance on secured borrowing

4. **Market Access Disruption:**
   - Credit spread widening makes new debt issuance uneconomic (>6% all-in rates)
   - Equity issuance at >20% discount to NAV per unit to fund obligations
   - DBRS places rating on "Under Review with Negative Implications"

5. **Failed Asset Disposition Program:**
   - Unable to execute $100M+ targeted asset sales within 12 months
   - Asset sales realized at <90% of IFRS value, impairing NAV
   - Disposition proceeds diverted to distributions instead of debt reduction

**Downgrade Scenario Example:**

Industrial market oversupply in GTA/Montreal leads to occupancy decline to 91%, same property NOI falls -2%, and rent spreads compress from +20% to +5%. Dream Industrial cannot execute asset sales at acceptable pricing and is forced to draw credit facility to $750M (95% utilization) to fund distributions and debt maturities. Debt/assets rises to 31% due to asset value declines. Coverage falls to 3.8x. Extended cash runway falls to 8 months. **Result: Downgrade to BBB (low) with negative outlook.**

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

### Moody's-Style 5-Factor Scorecard for REITs

| Factor | Weight | Sub-Factors | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **1. Scale** | 5% | Gross Assets: $8.27B | **A** | Above $10B threshold would be Aaa/Aa; $5-10B range is Baa. At $8.27B, Dream Industrial sits at upper end of Baa range, scoring low A. GLA of 72.9M SF across 338 assets provides meaningful scale and diversification. |
| **2. Business Profile** | 25% | See Sub-Factors Below | **A/Baa** | Blended score |
| 2A. Asset Quality | 12.5% | Trophy urban industrial, investment-grade markets | **A** | Portfolio concentrated in top-tier industrial markets (GTA, Montreal, Netherlands, Germany). 96% occupancy, 4.3-year WALT, and 22.9% rent upside in Canada demonstrates high-quality, well-located assets with strong tenant demand. Urban industrial positioning benefits from scarcity and alternative use optionality. |
| 2B. Market Position | 12.5% | Strong positions, favorable supply/demand in urban logistics | **A** | Dominant exposure to supply-constrained urban industrial markets. Canada: 9% CAGR in-place rent growth over 3 years, 22.9% mark-to-market upside. Europe: 85% of leases CPI-indexed, providing inflation hedge. U.S. exposure via JV limits direct exposure. Diversified tenant base (no single tenant >5% NOI) enhances stability. |
| **3. Access to Capital** | 20% | Unsecured debt markets, but liquidity-constrained | **Baa** | **Positive:** DBRS BBB rating provides access to unsecured bond markets (evidenced by $200M Series G issuance). 83.8% unencumbered assets support future debt capacity. **Negative:** Critical cash position (0.9-month runway) and negative AFCF indicate heavy reliance on continuous capital market access. Any market dislocation creates acute refinancing risk. Credit facility dependency (95% drawn at Q2) limits financial flexibility. **Assessment:** Access exists but fragility warrants Baa score. |
| **4. Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Conservative leverage, strong coverage | **A** | **Debt/Gross Assets: 26.8%** - Solidly within A category (25-35%), well below Baa threshold of 45%. **NOI/Interest Coverage: 4.77x** - Comfortably within A range (4.0-6.0x), well above Baa minimum of 3.0x. Net leverage of 26.3% provides substantial debt capacity cushion. Low secured debt (5.4% of assets) maintains financial flexibility. **Strong quantitative metrics support A score despite liquidity concerns.** |
| **5. Financial Policy** | 15% | Aggressive growth, distribution discipline moderate | **Baa/Ba** | **Growth-Oriented:** $543M acquisitions + $38M development capex in H1 2025 demonstrates prioritization of growth over deleveraging. NCIB buybacks ($20M) consume liquidity. **Distribution Sustainability:** FFO payout ratio of 68.9% is moderate, but AFCF payout ratio is negative (-135.6%), indicating unsustainable distribution policy from free cash flow perspective. **Refinancing:** Proactive debt issuance ($200M Series G) shows market access, but timing (post-Q2) suggests reactive rather than proactive liquidity management. **Assessment:** Aggressive financial policy with some flexibility warrants Baa/Ba score. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Weighted Average** | **A/Baa** | **Indicated Rating: BBB (mid)** |

### Scorecard Calculation:

- **Scale (5%):** A = 4.0 → Weighted score = 0.20
- **Business Profile (25%):** A = 4.0 → Weighted score = 1.00
  - Asset Quality (12.5%): A = 4.0 → 0.50
  - Market Position (12.5%): A = 4.0 → 0.50
- **Access to Capital (20%):** Baa = 3.0 → Weighted score = 0.60
- **Leverage & Coverage (35%):** A = 4.0 → Weighted score = 1.40
- **Financial Policy (15%):** Baa = 3.0 → Weighted score = 0.45

**Total Weighted Score:** 0.20 + 1.00 + 0.60 + 1.40 + 0.45 = **3.65**

**Rating Scale:**
- Aaa/Aa: 4.5-5.0
- A: 3.5-4.5
- Baa: 2.5-3.5
- Ba: 1.5-2.5
- B: <1.5

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** **A (low) / BBB (high)** based on weighted score of 3.65

**Actual DBRS Rating:** **BBB (mid)**

**Variance Analysis:**

The scorecard-indicated rating of **A (low) / BBB (high)** (score 3.65) is **0.15-0.65 notches higher** than the actual DBRS **BBB (mid)** rating (implied score 3.0-3.5). This variance likely reflects:

1. **Liquidity Penalty:** DBRS likely applies a -0.5 to -1.0 notch adjustment for the CRITICAL cash position and negative AFCF, despite strong underlying metrics.

2. **Financial Policy Penalty:** Aggressive growth strategy and distribution policy inconsistent with self-funding may warrant additional conservatism.

3. **Forward-Looking Risk:** Rating agencies incorporate forward-looking stress scenarios. The CRITICAL liquidity position and capital market dependency introduce execution risk that quantitative ratios alone do not capture.

4. **Peer Calibration:** DBRS may position Dream Industrial at BBB (mid) to maintain spread versus higher-rated Granite REIT (BBB high/A low) and lower-rated peers with weaker fundamentals.

**Conclusion:** The **BBB (mid)** rating appropriately balances strong asset quality and leverage metrics against material liquidity and financial policy concerns. The scorecard suggests potential for upgrade to **BBB (high)** if liquidity constraints are resolved and AFCF turns positive.

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**Funds From Operations (FFO):**
- **Reported FFO:** $149.4M (H1 2025) → $0.51/unit (diluted)
- **Calculated FFO (REALPAC):** $130.1M → $0.4445/unit (diluted)
- **Variance:** -$19.4M (-13.0%) - **EXCEEDS 5% threshold**
- **FFO Payout Ratio (Reported):** 68.9% - Moderate and sustainable from FFO perspective
- **YoY Growth:** +4.1% per unit - Positive momentum driven by rent growth and portfolio expansion

**Variance Reconciliation:**

The -13% FFO variance requires detailed reconciliation. Potential sources:

1. **JV Distributions ($17.1M):** REALPAC methodology includes actual distributions received from equity-accounted JVs. Issuer may use equity pickup method (share of JV net income) instead of cash distributions.

2. **Transaction Costs ($3.6M):** REALPAC adds back acquisition and business combination costs. Issuer may expense these immediately.

3. **Foreign Exchange ($2.1M):** REALPAC adjusts for unrealized FX gains/losses. Issuer may include realized and unrealized FX in FFO.

4. **Incremental Leasing Costs ($3.0M):** Timing differences in capitalization vs. expensing of leasing commissions.

**Recommendation:** Material variance warrants management discussion to ensure consistent peer comparison and investor transparency.

**Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO):**
- **Reported AFFO:** Not disclosed by issuer
- **Calculated AFFO (REALPAC):** $133.1M → $0.4547/unit (diluted)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio (Calculated):** Not calculable without issuer-reported AFFO
- **Analytical Challenge:** Lack of reported AFFO limits visibility into sustainable operating cash flow after sustaining capital expenditures

**Observation:** Dream Industrial focuses disclosure on FFO rather than AFFO. This is common among growth-oriented REITs that prioritize expansion over harvesting. However, for credit analysis, AFFO provides a more conservative measure of distribution sustainability. The calculated AFFO of $133.1M (vs. reported FFO of $149.4M) suggests sustaining leasing costs of $16.3M annually, reducing distributable cash flow.

---

**Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (ACFO):**
- **Calculated ACFO (REALPAC):** $221.3M → $0.756/unit (diluted)
- **ACFO Payout Ratio (Calculated):** 46.3% (based on $0.35/unit distribution × 292,674K diluted units = $102.4M distributions)
- **Coverage:** 2.16x (ACFO covers distributions 2.16 times) - **STRONG coverage from operating cash flow perspective**
- **YoY Growth:** Not calculable without prior period ACFO

**Key Insight:** ACFO of $221.3M is **66% higher** than calculated FFO of $130.1M and **66% higher** than reported FFO of $149.4M. This substantial difference arises from:

1. **Add-Back of Non-Cash Items:** ACFO starts from cash flow from operations ($157.5M) rather than net income, eliminating non-cash fair value adjustments.

2. **JV Distributions Received:** $17.1M actual cash received from joint ventures, which provides cash for distributions.

3. **Development CAPEX Add-Back:** $38.1M development capex is growth-oriented (not sustaining) and therefore excluded from ACFO calculation under REALPAC methodology.

4. **Working Capital Adjustment:** $1.9M favorable working capital change improves ACFO.

**Credit Implication:** The strong ACFO coverage of 2.16x suggests distributions are **well-covered from operating cash flow** alone, despite negative AFCF. The key distinction:
- **ACFO measures operating sustainability** → Positive and strong (2.16x coverage)
- **AFCF measures self-funding capacity** → Negative due to growth investments

**Conclusion:** Dream Industrial's distributions are sustainable from operations but require external financing to fund growth capital deployment.

---

**Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF):**
- **Calculated AFCF:** -$73.5M → -$0.251/unit (diluted)
- **AFCF Coverage Metrics:**
  - Debt Service Coverage: -0.59x (**INSUFFICIENT** - cannot cover principal + interest from free cash flow)
  - Distribution Coverage: -0.74x (**INSUFFICIENT** - cannot cover distributions from free cash flow)
  - Self-Funding Ratio: -0.33x (**HIGH reliance on capital markets**)
- **AFCF Breakdown:**
  - ACFO: $0 (starting point - not used as base; calculation uses ACFO $221.3M internally)
  - Net Cash Flow from Investing (CFI): -$73.5M
    - Development CAPEX: -$38.1M (largest outflow)
    - Property Acquisitions: -$26.8M
    - JV Capital Contributions: -$37.0M
    - Property Dispositions: +$11.4M (proceeds)
    - JV Return of Capital: +$17.1M

**Critical Observation:**

Dream Industrial generated **negative free cash flow of -$73.5M** despite strong operations (ACFO of $221.3M). The $294.8M swing from ACFO to AFCF is driven by:

1. **Growth Capital Deployment:** $101.9M (development + acquisitions + JV contributions)
2. **Limited Asset Recycling:** Only $28.5M proceeds from dispositions and JV returns

**Self-Funding Analysis:**

- **Total Financing Obligations:** $223.6M
  - Annualized Interest: $78.2M
  - Principal Repayments: $45.8M (estimated from financing cash flows)
  - Distributions: $99.6M
- **AFCF Available:** -$73.5M
- **Financing Gap:** $297.1M

**Implication:** Dream Industrial requires **$297.1M of external financing** over the 6-month period to fund its growth strategy, debt service, and distributions. This was provided by:
- Credit facility draws: $671.8M utilized (90% of $744.9M facility)
- Subsequent debt issuance: $200M Series G debentures (post-Q2)

**Credit Risk:** The REIT operates a **capital-intensive growth model** that cannot self-fund. During market stress (credit spread widening, equity market closure), the REIT would be forced to:
1. Suspend distributions (saving $99.6M annually)
2. Defer/cancel acquisitions (saving $53.6M run-rate)
3. Accelerate asset sales (potentially at discounts)

**Conclusion:** Negative AFCF is **normal for growth-stage REITs** but creates **material refinancing risk** that justifies the BBB (mid) rating rather than BBB (high) or A (low).

### Portfolio Quality Assessment

**Occupancy Metrics:**
- **In-Place Occupancy:** 94.1% (down from 95.3% at Dec 31, 2024)
- **In-Place + Committed:** 96.0% (up from 95.8% at Dec 31, 2024)
- **Observation:** Committed leases not yet commenced totaling ~1.9% of GLA (1.4M SF) provide near-term occupancy visibility

**Portfolio Composition:**
- **Total GLA:** 72.9M SF across 338 assets (550 buildings)
- **Geographic Split:** Canada (primary - ~60%+ based on management focus), Europe (secondary - ~30-35%), U.S. (tertiary - JV exposure only)
- **Property Type:** Diversified industrial - distribution, urban logistics, light industrial

**Lease Maturity Profile:**
- **WALT:** 4.3 years (stable from prior periods)
- **Lease Rollover:** Management disclosed 3.3M SF leased from Q2-July 2025, suggesting meaningful rollover activity
- **Rent Escalations:**
  - Canada: 3.2% average contractual annual escalators
  - Europe: 85% of leases CPI-indexed with remainder having contractual steps

**Rent Growth Dynamics:**

| Market | Mark-to-Market Spread | In-Place Rent Growth (YoY) | Recent Leasing Spread |
|--------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **Canada** | +22.9% | +11.9% (H1 2025) | +38.5% (Q2-July leasing) |
| **Europe** | +4.6% | +1.5% (Q2 2025) | 0% (in-line with prior rents) |
| **Portfolio** | ~15-18% blended | +8-10% blended | +20.0% weighted average |

**Key Insight:** Canada portfolio exhibits **exceptional rent growth momentum** with 11.9% YoY growth in in-place rents and 38.5% spreads on recent renewals. This suggests:
1. Strong demand for well-located urban industrial space
2. In-place rents significantly below market
3. Contractual escalators (+3.2%) compounding with mark-to-market upside

Europe portfolio shows more modest growth (1.5% YoY) but benefits from CPI indexation providing inflation hedge.

**Same Property NOI Growth:**
- **Q2 2025:** 5.0% YoY (constant currency)
- **H1 2025:** 4.1% YoY (constant currency)
- **Canada:** 8.0% growth (Q2) driven by 11.5% Ontario, 4.7% Quebec, 4.3% Western Canada
- **Europe:** 1.5% growth (Q2) driven by CPI indexation and new leases

**Comparative Assessment:**

Dream Industrial's 4.1% same property NOI growth compares favorably to:
- **Granite REIT:** Not disclosed in Q2 2025 materials reviewed
- **Nexus Industrial REIT:** 2.8% industrial SPNOI growth (Q2 2025)
- **Industry Average:** ~2-4% for diversified industrial REITs

**Conclusion:** Dream Industrial demonstrates **above-peer NOI growth** driven by successful rent mark-to-market realization and contractual escalators. This supports the **A** score for Business Profile in the scorecard.

---

### Unusual Trends and Risks

**1. Declining In-Place Occupancy Despite Strong Committed Occupancy**

- In-place occupancy fell from 95.3% (Dec 2024) to 94.1% (June 2025) - a -120 bps decline
- Committed occupancy rose from 95.8% to 96.0% - a +20 bps increase
- **Implication:** Near-term lease commencements will restore in-place occupancy, but the temporary decline may reflect:
  - Development project lease-up lag (new space delivered but tenants not yet moved in)
  - Expiries not yet replaced (time lag between expiry and new tenant occupancy)
  - Strategic vacancy for redevelopment/value-add projects

**Analytical Note:** The 96.0% committed occupancy provides comfort that the in-place decline is **temporary and strategic** rather than demand-driven weakness.

---

**2. Acceleration of Secured Debt Despite "Conservative Financial Policy"**

- Secured debt increased from 5.9% of total assets (Dec 2024) to 5.4% (June 2025) - reported as decline
- **However:** Secured debt as % of total debt = 14.1% (calculated from $2.21B total debt × 14.1% = $312M secured debt)
- For comparison, $312M secured debt / $8.27B total assets = 3.8% - lower than reported 5.4%

**Reconciliation Issue:** The MD&A reports 5.4% secured debt / total assets, but this appears inconsistent with the 14.1% secured debt / total debt metric. Further analysis required to reconcile.

**Credit Implication:** If secured debt is rising (even modestly), this could indicate:
- Difficulty accessing unsecured markets for certain financings
- Use of mortgage debt for acquisition financing
- Asset-level financing for developments

**Monitoring Point:** Track secured debt % in future quarters. Any increase toward >20% of total debt would be a **negative credit development** indicating potential unsecured market access constraints.

---

**3. Material Increase in Weighted Average Interest Rate**

- Face interest rate rose from 2.47% (Dec 2024) to 2.77% (June 2025) - a **+30 bps increase in 6 months**
- Annualized rate of increase: **+60 bps/year**
- **Drivers:**
  - New debt issuances at higher rates (e.g., $200M Series G at 4.287% before swap to 3.726%)
  - Refinancing of maturing low-cost debt from 2020-2021 vintage
  - Floating-rate debt repricing (if any) due to central bank rate increases

**Forward-Looking Concern:**

If the interest rate trend continues:
- 2025 year-end rate: ~3.0% (+53 bps from Dec 2024)
- 2026 year-end rate: ~3.6% (+113 bps from Dec 2024)
- 2027 year-end rate: ~4.2% (+173 bps from Dec 2024)

**Coverage Impact:**

| Scenario | Annualized Interest | NOI Required for 4.0x Coverage | Current NOI ($372.9M) Coverage |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Current (2.77%)** | $78.2M | $312.8M | **4.77x** ✓ |
| **Year-End 2025 (3.0%)** | $85.0M | $340.0M | **4.39x** ✓ |
| **Year-End 2026 (3.6%)** | $102.0M | $408.0M | **3.66x** ⚠️ |
| **Year-End 2027 (4.2%)** | $119.0M | $476.0M | **3.13x** ⚠️ |

**Conclusion:** Sustained interest rate increases pose **material coverage erosion risk**. By 2026-2027, coverage could fall to **3.5-3.7x**, approaching the Baa minimum of 3.0x. This underscores the importance of:
1. **NOI Growth:** Achieving 5%+ annual NOI growth to offset interest rate headwinds
2. **Deleveraging:** Reducing debt/assets from 26.8% to <25% to reduce absolute interest expense
3. **Fixed-Rate Debt:** Maintaining high % of fixed-rate debt (currently 70% per Granite REIT comparable disclosures)

---

**4. Minimal Dilution (Positive Credit Factor)**

- **Dilution:** 0.29% (859K deferred units / 291.8M basic units)
- **Materiality:** Minimal - no material impact on per-unit metrics
- **Convertible Debt:** $0 - no convertible debentures outstanding
- **Governance:** Enhanced disclosure (detailed breakdown provided)

**Credit Assessment:** ✓ Low dilution risk - minimal equity overhang, positive for creditworthiness

**Implication:** Minimal dilution provides **credibility to per-unit metrics** and eliminates forced conversion risk that could dilute existing unitholders during equity raises.

### Comparative Analysis

**1. Leverage Positioning:**

Dream Industrial REIT exhibits the **lowest debt/assets ratio** among peers at 26.8%, compared to Granite's 36.0% and Nexus's 48-49%. This positions Dream Industrial at the **conservative end of the peer spectrum** and well below the BBB category threshold of 45%.

**Interpretation:**
- Dream Industrial has **substantial debt capacity** to fund growth within investment-grade constraints
- The REIT could increase leverage by ~8-10 ppts to align with Granite's 36% without jeopardizing BBB rating
- Alternatively, the conservative leverage provides **cushion for asset value declines** or EBITDA deterioration

**Rating Implication:** Dream Industrial's superior leverage supports a **BBB (high) or A (low)** rating from a balance sheet perspective, offset by liquidity concerns.

---

**2. Coverage Metrics:**

Dream Industrial's **4.77x interest coverage** is **lower than Granite's 5.8x** but still comfortably within the A category range (4.0-6.0x). The -0.5x gap vs. peer average suggests:
- Granite's superior coverage may reflect lower leverage (36% debt/assets generates less interest expense)
- Dream Industrial's growth capital deployment may have increased debt faster than NOI growth
- Rising interest rates impacting Dream Industrial more than Granite (if Granite has more fixed-rate debt)

**Mitigation:** Dream Industrial's 4.77x coverage still provides **healthy cushion** above the Baa minimum of 3.0x (59% buffer).

---

**3. Per-Unit Metrics:**

Dream Industrial's **FFO per unit of $0.51** is **29% lower** than the peer average of $0.72 (heavily skewed by Granite's $1.46). However, this comparison is distorted by:
- **Scale Differences:** Granite's $1.46 FFO/unit reflects larger absolute FFO ($190M+ estimated) spread over smaller unit base (~130M units)
- **Distribution Policies:** Dream Industrial's $0.35/unit distribution vs. Granite's higher per-unit distribution
- **Currency:** All figures in CAD, but Granite's U.S. exposure may create translation effects

**More Meaningful Comparison - AFFO Per Unit:**

Dream Industrial's calculated **AFFO per unit of $0.45** is **19% higher** than the peer average of $0.38, driven by:
- Superior AFFO generation relative to Nexus ($0.45 vs. $0.313)
- Comparable to Granite (AFFO not disclosed by Granite, but 60% payout suggests ~$0.58/unit AFFO implied)

**Conclusion:** On an **AFFO basis** (more conservative and credit-relevant), Dream Industrial performs **in-line to slightly better** than peers.

---

**4. Payout Ratio Comparison:**

Dream Industrial's **calculated AFFO payout ratio of 77.8%** is:
- **Lower than Nexus (~100%)** - significantly more sustainable
- **Higher than Granite (60%)** - Granite maintains greater distribution cushion
- **In-line with peer average (79%)**

**Credit Interpretation:**
- Dream Industrial's 77.8% payout leaves **22.2% AFFO cushion** for distribution growth, debt reduction, or capital deployment
- Granite's 60% payout reflects more conservative distribution policy, supporting potential BBB (high) or A rating
- Nexus's ~100% payout is **unsustainable** and likely driving analyst concerns about distribution risk

**Positioning:** Dream Industrial's payout ratio is **moderate** - more conservative than Nexus (lower credit risk) but less conservative than Granite (higher credit quality). This aligns with the **BBB (mid)** rating.

---

**5. Operating Performance:**

Dream Industrial demonstrates **superior operating performance** vs. peers:
- **Occupancy: 96.0%** vs. peer average 94.4% (+1.6 ppt)
- **Same Property NOI Growth: 4.1%** vs. peer average 3.5% (+0.6 ppt)

**Key Drivers:**
1. **Rent Mark-to-Market Upside:** 22.9% in Canada (vs. Nexus 18.5%) provides substantial embedded growth
2. **Contractual Escalators:** 3.2% annual escalators in Canada compound with market rent growth
3. **Leasing Momentum:** 3.3M SF at 20.0% spread (vs. Nexus 395K SF at 38% spread) - higher volume, strong spread

**Conclusion:** Dream Industrial's **operating platform is best-in-class** among the peer group, supporting the **A** score for Business Profile.

---

**6. Scale and Diversification:**

Dream Industrial's **$8.27B asset base** is:
- **6% larger than Granite** ($7.8B)
- **335% larger than Nexus** ($1.9B)
- **70% above peer average** ($4.85B)

**Geographic Diversification:**
- **Dream Industrial:** Canada (primary), Europe (secondary), U.S. (JV exposure) - **3-continent platform**
- **Granite:** Canada (primary), U.S. (secondary), Europe (tertiary) - **3-continent platform**
- **Nexus:** Canada-focused (11.7M SF, 88 properties) - **single-country concentration**

**Credit Implication:** Dream Industrial and Granite benefit from **superior geographic diversification** vs. Nexus, reducing concentration risk and providing currency hedge benefits. This supports higher credit ratings for DIR/GRT vs. NXR.

|---------|------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **1** | **Granite REIT** | Lowest net leverage (36%), highest coverage (5.8x), best payout ratio (60%), near-full occupancy (94.8%) | Smaller scale ($7.8B), limited NOI growth disclosure | **BBB (high) / A (low)** |
| **2** | **Dream Industrial REIT** | Lowest debt/assets (26.8%), highest scale ($8.3B), best NOI growth (4.1%), best occupancy (96.0%), strong diversification | **CRITICAL liquidity (0.9mo runway), negative AFCF, capital market dependency** | **BBB (mid)** |
| **3** | **Nexus Industrial REIT** | Strong leasing spreads (38-82%), growing AFFO per unit (+10.6% YoY), pure-play industrial focus | Highest leverage (48-49%), highest payout ratio (~100%), smallest scale ($1.9B), single-country concentration | **BBB (low) / BB (high)** |

**Analytical Conclusion:**

Dream Industrial REIT ranks **#2 in the peer group** with a **BBB (mid)** rating appropriately positioned between:
- **Granite REIT** (BBB high/A low) - superior coverage, lower payout, better liquidity
- **Nexus Industrial REIT** (BBB low/BB high) - higher leverage, unsustainable payout, weaker scale

The **BBB (mid)** rating reflects Dream Industrial's **strong asset quality and leverage metrics** balanced against **material liquidity and financial policy concerns**. The REIT's positioning is consistent with its operational performance (#1 in NOI growth, #1 in occupancy) but penalized for liquidity fragility.

### Business Strategy

Dream Industrial REIT articulates a clear **growth-oriented strategy** focused on building a diversified, high-quality industrial portfolio while maintaining investment-grade financial discipline. The strategy encompasses six core pillars:

### 1. **Resilient High-Quality Industrial Portfolio**

**Strategic Objective:** Own and operate a diversified portfolio of urban industrial assets in markets with strong operating fundamentals, limited supply, and long-term demand drivers.

**Execution:**
- **Urban Industrial Focus:** Target assets located in or near major population centers with exceptional versatility (warehousing, light assembly, industrial outside storage, last-mile logistics)
- **Alternative Use Optionality:** Continuously evaluate highest and best use for assets, including residential/mixed-use intensification, self-storage projects, and data center conversions
- **Infill Location Scarcity:** Leverage constrained land availability in urban markets to enhance value creation potential

**Evidence from Q2 2025 Results:**
- 96.0% occupancy (in-place and committed) demonstrates strong tenant demand
- 22.9% mark-to-market rent upside in Canada reflects below-market in-place rents on high-quality assets
- 3.3M SF of leasing at 20.0% weighted average spread (Q2-July 2025) validates asset quality

**Credit Implication:** ✓ High-quality portfolio supports **A** score for Asset Quality (Factor 2A)

---

### 2. **Vertically Integrated Platform**

**Strategic Objective:** Leverage in-house expertise across all real estate functions to drive operational excellence, cost efficiency, and competitive advantage in sourcing acquisitions.

**Platform Capabilities:**
- **In-House Disciplines:** Investments, financing, asset management, property management, development, construction, leasing, marketing, sustainability, legal, tax, compliance
- **Team Scale:** 150+ professionals across 10 regional offices in key markets (Canada, Europe, U.S.)
- **Asset Manager Partnership:** Dream Unlimited Corp. provides comprehensive services and deal flow

**Competitive Advantages:**
1. **Proprietary Deal Flow:** Well-established local relationships enable off-market acquisition sourcing
2. **Development Expertise:** In-house construction/development capability supports value-add initiatives (intensification, greenfield, redevelopment)
3. **Tenant Relationships:** Occupier-focused program drives retention and expansion opportunities

**Evidence from Q2 2025 Results:**
- $6.1M net property management income in H1 2025 (+20.1% YoY) from third-party ventures demonstrates platform scalability
- Successful execution of $543M acquisitions ($460M Dream Summit JV + $83M wholly-owned) reflects deal flow access
- Solar program (25 projects, 22MW capacity, 11% yield on cost) showcases value-creation capabilities

**Credit Implication:** ✓ Vertically integrated platform supports **A** score for Business Profile (Factor 2)

---

### 3. **Continuous Portfolio Optimization (Capital Recycling)**

**Strategic Objective:** Regularly evaluate and benchmark each asset to identify disposition candidates and reinvest proceeds into higher-quality, less management-intensive assets.

**Acquisition Criteria:**
1. Expected cash flow returns (6-8% going-in cap rates)
2. Replacement cost of the asset (buy below replacement cost)
3. Location, functionality, and appeal to future tenants
4. Sustainability attributes and portfolio complementarity
5. Per-unit accretion to FFO/AFFO/NAV

**Disposition Strategy:**
- Target non-core assets, smaller properties, or those with limited upside potential
- Recycle proceeds into larger, higher-quality assets in core markets
- Pursue user sales (owner-occupiers) to achieve premium pricing

**Evidence from Q2 2025 Results:**
- **Dispositions:** $11.4M realized in H1 2025 (modest progress)
- **Planned Dispositions:** $100M of assets under LOI or advanced negotiations
- **Dream Summit JV Disposition:** $18.7M (post-Q2) at 15% premium to IFRS value demonstrates pricing power

**Gap vs. Strategy:**
- **Shortfall:** Only $11.4M realized vs. $543M deployed in acquisitions = **47.8:1 acquisition-to-disposition ratio**
- **Implication:** REIT is in **net growth mode**, not recycling mode, consuming liquidity and necessitating external financing

**Credit Implication:** ⚠️ Execution gap on dispositions contributes to liquidity constraints and negative AFCF

- Solar NOI: $1.3M in H1 2025 (run-rate ~$2.6M annually)
- Development CAPEX: $38.1M in H1 2025 (active deployment)
- Same property NOI growth: 4.1% YoY (constant currency) demonstrates successful asset management

**Credit Implication:** ✓ Strong organic growth supports **A** score for Market Position (Factor 2B) and validates growth strategy

---

### 5. **Strategic Private Partnerships (Fee Income Diversification)**

**Strategic Objective:** Leverage local operating platforms to generate recurring revenue from property management and leasing services while maintaining alignment through retained equity interests.

**Current Partnerships:**

1. **Dream Summit JV:**
   - **Partner:** GIC (sovereign wealth fund)
   - **Dream Industrial Ownership:** 10% equity interest
   - **Scale:** $460M of acquisitions in H1 2025 (at 100%; $46M at Dream Industrial's share)
   - **Services Provided:** Property management, construction management, leasing at market rates
   - **Benefit:** Fee income + participation in upside via 10% equity stake

2. **U.S. Fund:**
   - **Structure:** Private U.S. industrial fund
   - **Dream Industrial Role:** Property management, construction management, leasing services
   - **Services:** Market-rate fees for third-party management
   - **Benefit:** Fee income from U.S. market without balance sheet capital deployment

**Financial Impact:**
- **Net Property Management Income:** $6.1M in H1 2025 (+20.1% YoY growth)
- **Run-Rate:** ~$12M annually
- **Growth Driver:** Organic revenue growth + increased scale of private ventures (~$1B+ of acquisitions over past 24 months)

**Credit Implication:** ✓ Fee income diversification provides **recurring non-rental revenue** and demonstrates platform scalability

---

### 6. **Conservative Financial Policy**

**Strategic Objective:** Operate with financial discipline focused on maintaining strong balance sheet, liquidity position, and investment-grade credit rating.

**Stated Financial Targets:**
1. **Conservative Leverage:** Target implied (not explicitly stated as 25-30% debt/assets, but current 26.8% suggests disciplined approach)
2. **Natural Currency Hedging:** Match foreign currency assets with foreign currency debt (EUR debt for EUR assets)
3. **Unencumbered Asset Pool:** Build high-quality unencumbered pool to support unsecured debt capacity
   - Current: $6.1B unencumbered (83.8% of investment properties)
   - Supports unsecured debt issuance and future growth
4. **Reduce Borrowing Costs:** Optimize debt structure (70% fixed-rate, cross-currency swaps to reduce EUR debt costs)
5. **Preserve Liquidity:** Maintain credit facility availability and cash reserves

**Execution Evidence from Q2 2025:**
- **Debt/Assets:** 26.8% - **conservative and well below BBB threshold of 45%**
- **Secured Debt:** 5.4% of assets (14.1% of total debt) - **low secured debt maintains financial flexibility**
- **Credit Rating:** DBRS BBB (mid) - **maintained since inception**
- **$200M Series G Debenture:** Issued post-Q2 at 4.287%, swapped to 3.726% EUR - demonstrates market access and cost optimization

**Gap vs. "Conservative Financial Policy" Claim:**

**⚠️ Contradictory Evidence:**
1. **Liquidity:** 0.9-month cash runway - **NOT conservative**
2. **AFCF:** -$73.5M negative free cash flow - **NOT conservative**
3. **Self-Funding Ratio:** -0.33x - **NOT conservative** (reliant on capital markets)
4. **Acquisition Pace:** $543M in H1 2025 vs. $11.4M dispositions - **aggressive growth, not conservative**
5. **NCIB Buybacks:** $20M unit buybacks while cash-constrained - **questionable capital allocation**

**Interpretation:** Dream Industrial defines "conservative financial policy" **primarily through balance sheet metrics** (leverage, secured debt %, unencumbered assets) rather than **liquidity or self-funding metrics**. The REIT operates a **growth-first strategy** that deploys capital aggressively while maintaining leverage discipline. This creates a **paradox**:
- **Conservative:** Leverage, asset quality, credit rating
- **Aggressive:** Liquidity management, free cash flow, distribution policy

**Credit Implication:** ⚠️ Financial policy is **Baa/Ba** (Factor 5) - aggressive growth orientation with moderate financial discipline

---

### Strategic Synthesis: Growth-Oriented Harvester or Growth REIT?

**Classification:** **Growth-Oriented REIT with Harvest Optionality**

Dream Industrial exhibits characteristics of both strategies:

**Growth Indicators:**
1. $543M acquisitions in H1 2025 (annual run-rate $1.1B+)
2. $38M development CAPEX (active development pipeline)
3. Minimal asset dispositions ($11.4M) - not recycling capital
4. Negative AFCF (-$73.5M) - cannot self-fund growth
5. Rising GLA (72.9M SF, up from 71.8M SF at Dec 2024)

**Harvest Indicators:**
1. FFO payout ratio 68.9% - distributing majority of FFO
2. Distributions maintained at $0.70/unit - prioritizing unitholder yield
3. DBRS BBB rating - commitment to investment-grade status limits leverage expansion
4. 83.8% unencumbered assets - harvesting optionality (could monetize via asset sales or secured debt)

**Conclusion:**

Dream Industrial is executing a **"growth within investment-grade constraints" strategy** that prioritizes:
1. **Portfolio expansion** (acquisitions, development, JV participation)
2. **Distribution stability** (68.9% payout maintained)
3. **Leverage discipline** (26.8% debt/assets maintained below 30%)

The strategy is **sustainable as long as capital markets remain accessible** for debt refinancing and equity issuance. During market stress, the REIT would likely **shift to harvest mode** (suspend acquisitions, accelerate dispositions, potentially cut distributions) to preserve financial flexibility.

**Rating Implication:** Strategy supports **BBB (mid)** rating - strong asset quality and leverage discipline offset by capital market dependency and liquidity constraints.

**Note:** Bridge analysis uses REALPAC-calculated values for cross-issuer comparability.

#### 2.7 AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow) Analysis

**What is AFCF:**
AFCF extends the analysis beyond ACFO to measure cash available for financing obligations after ALL investing activities (acquisitions, development, JV investments). It provides the most conservative view of true free cash flow generation.

**Formula:** AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

**Note:** AFCF is always a calculated metric - issuers do not report this standard. Our calculation uses REALPAC-compliant ACFO.

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** Yes

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the forward-looking speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves based on current run rate. This is a **liquidity stress test** assuming NO future access to capital markets. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions).

**Formula:**
```
Mandatory Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (period amounts)
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period
```

**Note:** New financing is NOT subtracted - burn rate assumes no future capital raises.

**Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Reporting Period | Assessment |

| Liquidity Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Cash and Cash Equivalents** | 42,595 | End of period |
| **Marketable Securities** | 0 | Liquid investments |
| **Less: Restricted Cash** | (0) | Not available for operations |
| **Available Cash** | 42,595 | Immediately available |
| **Undrawn Credit Facilities** | 671,807 | Remaining capacity |
| **Total Available Liquidity** | 714,402 | Cash + facilities |

**Cash Runway Analysis:**

| Scenario | Liquidity Base | Runway (Months) | Runway (Years) | Depletion Date | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash Only** | 42,595 | 0.9 | 0.1 | 2025-07-25 | CRITICAL |
| **Extended** (w/ facilities) | 714,402 | 14.4 | 1.2 | 2026-09-05 | CRITICAL |

**Runway Calculation:**
- **Cash Only:** Available Cash (42,595) ÷ Monthly Burn (49,511) = 0.9 months
- **Extended:** Total Liquidity (714,402) ÷ Monthly Burn (49,511) = 14.4 months

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Risk Level | Risk Score | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | CRITICAL | 4/4 | 🚨 Critical Risk - Immediate financing required (< 6 months) |

**Risk Thresholds:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (Score 4): < 6 months runway - Immediate financing required
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (Score 3): 6-12 months runway - Near-term capital raise needed
- ⚠️ **MODERATE** (Score 2): 12-24 months runway - Plan financing within 12 months
- ✓ **LOW** (Score 1): > 24 months runway - Adequate liquidity runway

**Warning Flags:**
None identified

**Recommendations:**
- Suspend or reduce distributions immediately
- Accelerate non-core asset sales
- Pursue emergency financing (bridge loan, equity raise)
- Defer all non-critical capital expenditures
- Engage restructuring advisors

**Sustainable Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Target Runway** | 24 months | Management target |
| **Sustainable Monthly Burn** | 1,775 | Maximum sustainable burn rate |
| **Actual Monthly Burn** | -49,511 | Current burn rate |
| **Excess/(Deficit) Burn** | 47,736 | Above sustainable - Overspending by $47,736/month |

**Burn Rate Interpretation:**
AFCF of $-73,466 covers -33% of mandatory obligations ($223,598). Monthly cash deficit of $49,511 must be funded through capital markets or asset sales.

**Credit Implications:**
🚨 Critical - High dependence on capital markets and undrawn credit facilities

#### 4.4 Liquidity Assessment

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case (60% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. **Asset Sales:** Successful execution of $100-150M dispositions at 95-100% of IFRS value within 12 months
2. **Occupancy:** Stable at 95-97% as committed leases commence and leasing momentum continues
3. **Same Property NOI Growth:** 3.5-4.5% driven by rent mark-to-market realization (22.9% upside in Canada) and contractual escalators (3.2%)
4. **Acquisitions:** Moderate growth of $100-200M/year (down from $543M run-rate in H1 2025) funded by dispositions and debt issuance
5. **Interest Rates:** Weighted average rate increases to 3.0-3.2% by year-end 2025 as maturing low-cost debt refinanced at current market rates
6. **Distributions:** Maintained at $0.70/unit annually (current $0.35 semi-annual rate)
7. **Development Pipeline:** $50-75M annual development capex on existing excess land, generating 8%+ yields

**Pro Forma Metrics (12-month forward):**

| Metric | Current (Q2 2025) | Base Case (Q2 2026) | Change | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 26.8% | 25.5% | -1.3 ppt | ✓ Deleveraging |
| **Net Debt** | $2.17B | $2.05B | -$120M | ✓ Debt reduction |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | 4.77x | 4.55x | -0.22x | ⚠️ Modest compression |
| **Occupancy** | 96.0% | 96.5% | +0.5 ppt | ✓ Stable/improving |
| **AFCF** | -$73.5M | +$25M | +$98.5M | ✓ Positive free cash flow |
| **Self-Funding Ratio** | -0.33x | 0.15x | +0.48x | ⚠️ Still <1.0x |
| **Cash Runway (Available)** | 0.9 months | 3-4 months | +2-3 months | ⚠️ Improved but below target |
| **Available Liquidity** | $714.4M | $650M | -$64M | ✓ Adequate |

**Calculation Details:**

**Debt Reduction:**
- Asset sales: $125M × 97.5% realized = $122M proceeds
- Applied to debt paydown: $122M
- New debt for acquisitions: $150M × 50% LTV = $75M
- Net debt change: -$122M + $75M = -$47M
- Additional amortization/term debt repayment: -$73M
- **Total net debt reduction: -$120M**

**NOI Growth:**
- Current NOI: $372.9M (annualized from H1 2025)
- Growth: 4.0% × $372.9M = +$14.9M
- New NOI: $387.8M
- New interest expense: $85M (at 3.1% on $2.74B debt)
- **New coverage: $387.8M / $85M = 4.56x**

**AFCF Improvement:**
- ACFO: $221.3M (H1 2025) → $240M (annualized with 4% growth)
- Net CFI: Reduced to -$75M (lower acquisition pace, offset by asset sales)
- **AFCF: $240M + (-$75M) = +$165M annually → +$82.5M semi-annual**
- **Self-funding ratio:** $165M / ($170M interest + $146M principal + $204M distributions) = $165M / $520M = **0.32x** (revised - still <1.0x)

**Adjusted Calculation:**
- Debt service (interest only): $85M
- Principal repayments: $90M (estimated)
- Total debt service: $175M
- Distributions: $204M
- **Total obligations: $379M**
- AFCF: $165M
- **Self-funding ratio: $165M / $379M = 0.44x**

**Note:** Base case still shows self-funding ratio <1.0x, indicating **continued capital market reliance** but at reduced magnitude.

**Rating Impact:** **STABLE at BBB (mid)**

**Rationale:** Base case reflects **successful execution** of disposition program, moderate deleveraging, and maintained operational performance. Coverage compression from rising rates is offset by NOI growth. AFCF turns positive but remains insufficient for full self-funding, requiring ongoing (but reduced) capital market access. Liquidity improves modestly but remains constrained. **No rating change warranted** - BBB (mid) rating confirmed.

---

### Upside Case (25% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. **Asset Sales:** Accelerated disposition of $250-300M at 105-110% of IFRS value (premium pricing reflecting strong investor demand)
2. **Occupancy:** Improves to 97-98% as development projects fully lease up and market remains tight
3. **Same Property NOI Growth:** Accelerates to 6-7% driven by faster rent mark-to-market realization and CPI escalators in Europe
4. **Acquisitions:** Suspended for 12-18 months to prioritize balance sheet strengthening
5. **AFFO Payout Cut:** Distribution reduced from $0.70/unit to $0.60/unit (-14% cut) to create cash flow cushion
6. **Interest Rates:** Favorable refinancing environment allows opportunistic debt paydown and rate reduction to 2.9%

**Pro Forma Metrics:**

| Metric | Current (Q2 2025) | Upside Case (Q2 2026) | Change | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 26.8% | 22.5% | -4.3 ppt | ✓✓ Strong deleveraging |
| **Net Debt** | $2.17B | $1.90B | -$270M | ✓✓ Material debt reduction |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | 4.77x | 5.85x | +1.08x | ✓✓ Into A category range |
| **Occupancy** | 96.0% | 97.5% | +1.5 ppt | ✓✓ Best-in-class |
| **AFCF** | -$73.5M | +$120M | +$193.5M | ✓✓ Strong positive free cash flow |
| **Self-Funding Ratio** | -0.33x | 0.75x | +1.08x | ✓✓ Approaching self-funding |
| **Cash Runway (Available)** | 0.9 months | 8-10 months | +7-9 months | ✓✓ Comfortable liquidity |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 77.8% | 65% | -12.8 ppt | ✓✓ Conservative distribution policy |

**Rating Impact:** **UPGRADE to BBB (high) with stable/positive outlook**

**Rationale:** Upside case reflects **transformational balance sheet improvement** through aggressive asset recycling, distribution discipline, and operational excellence. Debt/assets falling to 22.5% positions Dream Industrial at the **low end of the A category**, while coverage of 5.85x exceeds the A range midpoint. AFCF self-funding ratio of 0.75x (though still <1.0x) demonstrates substantial improvement, and cash buildup to 8-10 months runway eliminates acute liquidity concerns. Distribution cut signals **management prioritization of financial strength** over unitholder yield. **Upgrade to BBB (high)** reflects improved credit metrics with potential for **further upgrade to A (low)** if self-funding ratio exceeds 1.0x and metrics sustained for 4+ quarters.

---

### Downside Case (12% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. **Asset Sales Struggle:** Only $50M of dispositions realized at 90-95% of IFRS value (10% discount) due to weak investor appetite
2. **Occupancy Decline:** Falls to 92-93% due to major tenant departures (e.g., 2-3% of NOI) or development project lease-up delays
3. **Same Property NOI Decline:** Negative growth of -1% to 0% due to rent concessions, higher operating costs (property taxes, utilities), and tenant defaults
4. **Refinancing Challenge:** Unable to refinance $200M of maturing debt in unsecured bond market; forced to use secured mortgage debt at 5.5% rate
5. **Interest Rate Spike:** Weighted average rate increases to 3.8% as floating-rate debt reprices and refinancing occurs at elevated spreads
6. **Distribution Maintained:** Management resists distribution cut to preserve unitholder confidence, continuing $0.70/unit payout

**Pro Forma Metrics:**

| Metric | Current (Q2 2025) | Downside Case (Q2 2026) | Change | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------|------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 26.8% | 29.5% | +2.7 ppt | ⚠️ Approaching Baa upper bound (35%) |
| **Net Debt** | $2.17B | $2.25B | +$80M | ⚠️ Leverage expansion |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | 4.77x | 3.45x | -1.32x | ⚠️⚠️ Approaching Baa minimum (3.0x) |
| **Occupancy** | 96.0% | 92.5% | -3.5 ppt | ⚠️⚠️ Material decline |
| **AFCF** | -$73.5M | -$150M | -$76.5M | ⚠️⚠️ Worsening negative free cash flow |
| **Self-Funding Ratio** | -0.33x | -0.65x | -0.32x | ⚠️⚠️ Doubled reliance on external financing |
| **Cash Runway (Available)** | 0.9 months | 0.3 months | -0.6 months | 🚨 CRITICAL - near depletion |
| **Secured Debt %** | 14.1% | 25% | +10.9 ppt | ⚠️⚠️ Unsecured market access constrained |

**Rating Impact:** **DOWNGRADE to BBB (low) with negative outlook**

**Rationale:** Downside case reflects **deteriorating credit fundamentals** across all key metrics. Coverage falling to 3.45x approaches the Baa minimum of 3.0x (only 15% buffer), while debt/assets rising to 29.5% nears the Baa upper bound of 35% (19% buffer). Most concerning is the **doubling of cash burn** (AFCF from -$73.5M to -$150M) and **near-depletion of cash runway** to 0.3 months, creating **acute refinancing pressure**. Forced use of secured debt (rising to 25% of total) signals **loss of unsecured market access**, a key hallmark of investment-grade credit quality. **Downgrade to BBB (low)** reflects increased default risk and potential for further downgrades if operational deterioration continues. **Negative outlook** indicates high probability of further downgrade to **BB (high)** if coverage falls below 3.0x or secured debt exceeds 30% of total debt.

---

### Stress Case (3% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. **Recession Scenario:** EBITDA declines 15% due to widespread tenant defaults, rent concessions, and occupancy collapse to 85-87%
2. **Refinancing Freeze:** Unable to access debt capital markets; existing credit facility covenant breach triggers acceleration clause
3. **Forced Asset Sales:** Emergency disposition of $300-400M of assets at 20-25% discount to IFRS value to raise liquidity
4. **Distribution Suspension:** Emergency distribution cut to $0 to preserve cash
5. **Development Losses:** Write-down of $50-75M on development projects due to inability to lease space or complete construction
6. **Interest Rate Spike:** Refinancing (where available) occurs at 7-8% rates due to credit stress and lender risk aversion

**Pro Forma Metrics:**

| Metric | Current (Q2 2025) | Stress Case (Q2 2026) | Change | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 26.8% | 38-42% | +11.2-15.2 ppt | 🚨 Exceeds Baa threshold (45%) approaching |
| **Net Debt** | $2.17B | $2.0B | -$170M | Forced deleveraging via asset sales |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | 4.77x | 1.8-2.2x | -2.6x to -3.0x | 🚨🚨 BELOW Baa minimum (3.0x) |
| **Occupancy** | 96.0% | 86% | -10 ppt | 🚨🚨 Severe demand shock |
| **AFCF** | -$73.5M | -$250M+ | -$176.5M+ | 🚨🚨 Extreme cash burn |
| **Self-Funding Ratio** | -0.33x | -1.5x to -2.0x | -1.2x to -1.7x | 🚨🚨 Completely unsustainable |
| **Cash Runway** | 0.9 months | Immediate crisis | N/A | 🚨 Going concern risk |
| **Credit Facility Breach** | No | Yes | Covenant breach | 🚨 Acceleration/cross-default |

**Calculation Details:**

**EBITDA Decline:**
- Current NOI: $372.9M
- 15% decline: -$55.9M
- New NOI: $317M
- Plus property management income: $6M
- **Approximate EBITDA: $323M**

**Interest Expense:**
- Debt: $2.0B (after forced asset sales)
- Weighted average rate: 5.5% (blended of existing 2.77% and new 7-8% refinancing)
- **Annualized interest: $110M**

**Coverage:**
- **EBITDA / Interest: $323M / $110M = 2.9x** - **BELOW Baa minimum of 3.0x**

**Debt/Assets:**
- Asset sales: $350M realized at 75% of IFRS value = $262.5M proceeds
- Write-downs on remaining portfolio: -5% = -$400M fair value decline
- New asset base: $8.27B - $350M (sold) - $400M (write-down) = **$7.52B**
- Debt after asset sales applied to paydown: $2.17B - $262.5M + $90M (additional draws to survive) = **$2.0B**
- **Debt/Assets: $2.0B / $7.52B = 26.6%** - **BELOW Baa threshold but MISLEADING due to fire-sale dynamics**

**Adjusted Debt/Assets (Stressed Fair Value):**
- If assets marked to market at distressed valuations (additional -10-15% beyond write-downs): $7.52B × 0.88 = **$6.62B**
- **Debt/Assets: $2.0B / $6.62B = 30.2%** - **Still investment grade but deteriorating**

**NAV Erosion:**
- Asset write-downs: -$400M
- Fire-sale losses: -$87.5M (25% discount on $350M IFRS value)
- Development write-downs: -$65M
- **Total NAV impairment: -$552.5M**
- NAV per unit: Current $16.69 → Stressed $14.80 → **-11.3% NAV decline**

**Rating Impact:** **MULTI-NOTCH DOWNGRADE to BB (high) or BB (mid) with negative outlook**

**Rationale:** Stress case reflects **severe credit deterioration** approaching distressed territory. Coverage falling **below the Baa minimum of 3.0x** to 2.2x (or lower) triggers **automatic downgrade to BB category**. Credit facility covenant breach creates **cross-default risk** across all debt, potentially accelerating maturities and forcing bankruptcy/restructuring. Forced asset sales at 75% of IFRS value **crystallize losses** and impair NAV by -11%. Distribution suspension, while necessary, **signals financial distress** and may trigger unitholder lawsuits or activist campaigns. **Multi-notch downgrade to BB (high) or BB (mid)** reflects **loss of investment-grade status** and **heightened default risk** (though not imminent given asset sales can fund near-term obligations). **Negative outlook** indicates potential for further downgrades to **B category** if restructuring becomes necessary or going concern issues emerge.

**Covenant Breach Triggers:**

Most credit agreements for REITs include:
1. **Debt Service Coverage Ratio:** Minimum 1.4-1.5x (Dream Industrial likely at ~2.0x currently, falling to 1.2-1.3x in stress case)
2. **Leverage Covenant:** Maximum 60-65% debt-to-assets (Dream Industrial at 26.8%, rising to 30-35% in stress case - **likely still compliant**)
3. **Interest Coverage:** Minimum 2.0-2.5x (Dream Industrial at 4.77x, falling to 2.2x in stress case - **may breach if minimum is 2.5x**)
4. **Unencumbered Asset Pool:** Minimum 150-200% of unsecured debt (Dream Industrial at ~275% currently, falling to 200-225% in stress case - **may approach covenant**)

**Conclusion:** Stress case is **low probability (3%)** but **high impact**. The scenario would likely trigger:
1. **Rating downgrade to BB category** (loss of investment-grade status)
2. **Forced restructuring or recapitalization** (emergency equity raise, asset sales, distribution suspension)
3. **Credit facility renegotiation** (higher fees, stricter covenants, reduced availability)
4. **Management/Board changes** (unitholder pressure, potential takeover/privatization)

### Downgrade Trigger Summary

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer | Likelihood in 12-18 Months |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|----------------------------|
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | >35% | 26.8% | 8.2 ppt | **LOW** (5%) - requires major asset value decline or debt increase |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | <3.5x | 4.77x | 1.27x (36% margin) | **LOW-MODERATE** (10%) - rising rates + flat NOI could trigger by 2026 |
| **Cash Runway (Extended)** | <6 months | 14.4 months | 8.4 months | **LOW** (5%) - requires failure to refinance credit facility or major cash burn |
| **Occupancy Rate (Sustained)** | <90% | 96.0% | 6.0 ppt | **VERY LOW** (2%) - requires severe demand shock |
| **AFCF Self-Funding Ratio** | <-0.75x | -0.33x | 0.42x | **LOW** (8%) - requires major growth capex increase or ACFO decline |
| **Coverage Below Baa Minimum** | <3.0x | 4.77x | 1.77x (59% margin) | **VERY LOW** (3%) - requires recession + rate spike scenario |
| **Credit Facility Covenant Breach** | Varies | Compliant | Unknown | **LOW** (5%) - requires severe operational deterioration |

**Overall Downgrade Probability (12-18 months):** **15-20%**

**Key Downgrade Catalysts:**
1. **Failed Asset Disposition Program** (35% weight) - inability to execute $100M+ sales at acceptable pricing
2. **Rising Interest Rates** (30% weight) - continued rate increases eroding coverage toward 3.5x
3. **Occupancy/NOI Deterioration** (20% weight) - tenant defaults or market oversupply reducing cash flow
4. **Liquidity Crisis** (15% weight) - credit facility reduction, covenant breach, or market access disruption

**Mitigants:**
- Strong asset quality (96% occupancy, 22.9% rent upside) provides NOI growth buffer
- Conservative leverage (26.8%) provides 8.2 ppt cushion before Baa threshold
- DBRS BBB rating maintained, indicating ongoing lender/bondholder confidence
- Post-Q2 $200M debenture issuance demonstrates continued unsecured market access

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

**Total Debt Service:**
```
Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Where:
  Annualized Interest = Interest expense for the reporting period (annualized)
  Principal Repayments = Scheduled principal payments for the reporting period

Note: Period amounts should be consistent (e.g., all quarterly or all annual)
```

**NOI / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
NOI / Debt Service Coverage = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight debt service coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient debt service coverage
```

**EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage = EBITDA / Total Debt Service

Where:
  EBITDA = NOI (for REITs, NOI approximates EBITDA)
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Note: For REITs, NOI/Debt Service and EBITDA/Debt Service are equivalent
```

**FFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
FFO / Debt Service Coverage = FFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.5x = Strong coverage
  ≥ 2.0x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Moderate coverage
  < 1.5x = Weak coverage
```

**AFFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFFO / Debt Service Coverage = AFFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong coverage (significant cushion after sustaining capex)
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient coverage
```

**ACFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
ACFO / Debt Service Coverage = ACFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.5x = Strong coverage (cash flow based)
  ≥ 1.25x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (cannot cover debt service from operating cash)
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**

    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```

     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```

**AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow):**
```
AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Where:
  ACFO = Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (per REALPAC 2023)
  Net CFI = Cash Flow from Investing Activities (IFRS statement)
            Including: Development CAPEX, acquisitions/dispositions,
                      JV capital contributions/returns

IMPORTANT - Double-Counting Prevention:
  ACFO already deducts:
    - Sustaining CAPEX (Adjustment 4)
    - Sustaining TI (Adjustment 6)
    - External leasing costs (Adjustment 5)

  CFI should ONLY include:
    - Development/growth CAPEX (NOT sustaining)
    - Property acquisitions and dispositions
    - JV capital contributions/returns (NOT distributions)
    - Business combinations
```

**AFCF Per Unit:**
```
AFCF per Unit (Basic) = AFCF / Common Units Outstanding (weighted average)

AFCF per Unit (Diluted) = AFCF / Diluted Units Outstanding (weighted average)

Where:
  Diluted Units = Basic Units + Dilutive Instruments
  Dilutive Instruments = RSUs + DSUs + Options + Convertible Debt + Warrants
```

### AFCF Coverage Metrics

**AFCF Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFCF Debt Service Coverage = AFCF / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (can cover debt service from free cash flow)
  < 1.0x = Reliant on capital markets for debt service
```

**AFCF Payout Ratio:**
```
AFCF Payout Ratio = (Total Distributions / AFCF) × 100

Assessment Thresholds:
  < 100% = Distributions sustainable from free cash flow
  ≥ 100% = Distributions exceed free cash flow
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Ratio:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Where:
  Total Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (per reporting period)

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no capital markets reliance)
  0.8-1.0x = Low reliance on external financing
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate reliance on capital markets
  < 0.5x = High reliance on capital markets

Note: Does NOT subtract new financing - measures inherent cash generation capacity
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Capacity:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Capacity = AFCF - (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Interpretation:
  Positive = Surplus cash after all financing obligations
  Negative = Deficit requiring external financing
```

### Burn Rate and Cash Runway Metrics

**Burn Rate Applicability:**
```
Burn Rate applies when: AFCF < Total Financing Obligations

Where:
  Total Financing Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions

Note: A REIT can have positive AFCF but still burn cash if free cash flow
      is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations.
```

**Monthly Burn Rate:**
```
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period

Where:
  Mandatory Obligations = Total Debt Service + Total Distributions
  New financing is NOT subtracted (assumes no future capital raises)
```

**Self-Funding Ratio (Burn Rate Context):**
```
Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / Mandatory Obligations

Interpretation:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no burn rate - generates surplus)
  0.8-1.0x = Low burn rate (nearly self-funding)
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate burn rate (moderate capital markets reliance)
  < 0.5x = High burn rate (high capital markets reliance)
```

**Cash Runway:**
```
Available Cash = Cash + Marketable Securities - Restricted Cash

Cash Runway (months) = Available Cash / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Extended Runway = (Available Cash + Undrawn Facilities) / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Where:
  Undrawn Facilities = Remaining credit facility capacity
  |Monthly Burn Rate| = Absolute value of monthly burn rate
```

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**
```
Risk Level based on Cash Runway:
  < 6 months    = CRITICAL (Score 4) - Immediate financing required
  6-12 months   = HIGH (Score 3) - Near-term capital raise needed
  12-24 months  = MODERATE (Score 2) - Plan financing within 12 months
  > 24 months   = LOW (Score 1) - Adequate liquidity runway
```

**Sustainable Burn Rate:**
```
Target Runway = 24 months (default)
Sustainable Monthly Burn = Available Cash / Target Runway

Excess Burn = Actual Monthly Burn - Sustainable Monthly Burn

Status:
  Excess Burn < 0 = Below sustainable (cash cushion)
  Excess Burn > 0 = Above sustainable (corrective action needed)
```

### Coverage Quality Assessment

**Distribution Coverage Assessment:**
```
Coverage Quality (applies to FFO/AFFO/ACFO/AFCF coverage):

  ≥ 1.3x = Strong coverage (30%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.1x = Adequate coverage (10%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage (< 10% cushion)
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (distributions exceed metric)
```

**Payout Ratio Assessment:**
```
Payout Ratio Quality (inverse of coverage):

  ≤ 77% = Strong (< 77% payout = 1.3x+ coverage)
  ≤ 91% = Adequate (< 91% payout = 1.1x+ coverage)
  < 100% = Tight (< 100% payout = 1.0x+ coverage)
  ≥ 100% = Insufficient (payout exceeds metric)
```
