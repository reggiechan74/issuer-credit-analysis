### Step 3: Data Extraction Guidelines

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Numbers:** No commas or $ signs (e.g., `2611435` not `$2,611,435`)
2. **Units:** All amounts in thousands (as shown in statements)
3. **Decimals:** Rates as decimals (e.g., `0.878` for 87.8%, NOT `87.8`)
4. **Field Names:** EXACTLY as shown above
5. **Structure:** FLAT - no nested objects in balance_sheet
6. **Most Recent Period:** Use latest period data (e.g., Q2 2025, six months)

**WHERE TO FIND DATA:**

**Balance Sheet:**
- Look for "Consolidated Balance Sheets" or "Statement of Financial Position"
- Usually in consolidated financial statements PDF
- Extract: total_assets, cash, mortgages (current/non-current), debentures, equity

**Income Statement:**
- Look for "Consolidated Statements of Operations" or "Statement of Income"
- Calculate NOI = Revenue - Operating Expenses - Realty Taxes
- Extract: revenue, NOI, interest expense, net income

**FFO/AFFO (Basic - Required):**
- Usually in MD&A document
- Look for "FFO and AFFO" section or tables showing "Funds from Operations"
- Extract: FFO, AFFO, per unit amounts, payout ratios
- **Minimum Required:** `ffo`, `affo`, `ffo_per_unit`, `affo_per_unit`, `distributions_per_unit`

**FFO/AFFO Components (COMPREHENSIVE - enables reconciliation tables):**
- Enables calculating FFO/AFFO from first principles per REALPAC methodology (Jan 2022)
- Look in "Notes to Financial Statements" - often has FFO/AFFO reconciliation table
- **Starting Point:** Net income from Statement of Comprehensive Income
- **Key Adjustments to Extract:**
  - **Adjustment A:** Unrealized fair value changes in investment properties
  - **Adjustment B:** Depreciation of depreciable real estate assets
  - **Adjustment C:** Amortization of tenant allowances
  - **Adjustment D:** Amortization of tenant/customer relationship intangibles
  - **Adjustment E:** Gains/losses from property sales
  - **Adjustment V (for AFFO):** Sustaining capital expenditures
  - **Adjustment W (for AFFO):** Leasing costs (internal + external)
  - **Adjustment X (for AFFO):** Tenant improvements (sustaining only)
  - **Adjustment Y (for AFFO):** Straight-line rent adjustment
- **Common Section:** "Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO" or "FFO Calculation"
- **Note:** Extract actual amounts shown in reconciliation, not formulas

**FFO/AFFO "Other" Adjustments (NEW - for complete reconciliation):**
- **Purpose:** Capture issuer-specific adjustments that don't fit REALPAC A-Z categories
- **When to use "Other" adjustments:**
  - Issuer uses non-standard terminology (e.g., "Expected credit loss on preferred investments")
  - Company-specific items (e.g., "Loss on redemption of debt", "Transaction costs")
  - Bundled categories that combine multiple REALPAC adjustments
  - Clearly an adjustment but doesn't match any A-Z category
- **Extraction priority:**
  1. **First:** Try to map to REALPAC categories (A-Z) - use exact matches when possible
  2. **If no match:** Extract as "Other" adjustment with EXACT description from issuer's table
- **How to extract Other adjustments:**
  - Use sequential labels: `other_1`, `other_2`, `other_3`, etc.
  - Copy the EXACT line item description from issuer's reconciliation table
  - Record amount (positive or negative as shown)
  - Note source page (e.g., "MD&A page 20")
- **Example Other adjustments:**
  - "Expected credit loss on preferred investments" → other_1
  - "Loss on redemption/modification of debt" → other_2
  - "Transaction costs - property dispositions" → other_3
  - "Impairment charges - non-real estate assets" → other_4
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION:**
  - Sum ALL adjustments (REALPAC A-Z + Other)
  - Compare to: Issuer-reported FFO minus Net Income = Total Adjustments
  - Flag if variance > 2% → indicates missing adjustments
  - Set `reconciliation_complete` = true if variance < 2%

**ACFO Components (OPTIONAL - for REALPAC ACFO calculation):**
- Enables calculating ACFO per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)
- Look for "Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows" for starting point
- **Starting Point:** Cash flow from operations (IFRS) from cash flow statement
- **Key Adjustments to Extract (if disclosed in notes):**
  - **Adjustment 1:** Change in working capital (to eliminate non-sustainable fluctuations)
  - **Adjustment 2:** Interest expense in financing activities (add back)
  - **Adjustment 3:** JV distributions received OR calculated JV ACFO
  - **Adjustment 4:** Sustaining/maintenance CAPEX (should match AFFO Adj V)
  - **Adjustment 5:** External leasing costs only
  - **Adjustment 6:** Sustaining tenant improvements (should match AFFO Adj X)
  - **Adjustment 14:** Interest expense/income timing adjustments
  - **Adjustment 16:** ROU (Right of Use) asset adjustments for ground leases
- **Common Sections:**
  - Cash flow statement for CFO starting point
  - Notes showing "Non-IFRS measures" or "ACFO reconciliation"
  - May be in MD&A "Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations" section
- **Important:** Many issuers don't disclose full ACFO - extract what's available

**Portfolio Data:**
- Look in MD&A "PROPERTY PORTFOLIO" section
- Search for: "XX properties", "Portfolio Summary", "GLA", "Occupancy"
- Common table headers: "Property count", "GLA (000's S.F.)", "% Occupied"
- **GLA Units:** Usually shown as "9,549" meaning 9,549,000 SF → enter as `9549000`

**Debt Details:**
- Current vs non-current mortgages usually in Notes (e.g., "Note 11: Mortgages")
- Debentures in separate note (e.g., "Note 12: Debentures")
- Check cash flow statement for recent repayments

**Cash Flow from Investing Activities (OPTIONAL - for AFCF analysis):**
- Look for "Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows" or "Cash Flow Statement"
- Find the "INVESTING ACTIVITIES" section
- Extract the following (use NEGATIVE for outflows, POSITIVE for inflows):
  - **Development CAPEX:** "Additions to investment properties" or "Development expenditures" (negative)
    - Should match `capex_development_acfo` if extracting ACFO components
  - **Property Acquisitions:** "Acquisition of investment properties" (negative)
  - **Property Dispositions:** "Proceeds from sale of investment properties" (positive)
  - **JV Capital Contributions:** "Investment in equity accounted entities" or "Contributions to joint ventures" (negative)
  - **JV Return of Capital:** "Distribution from equity accounted entities" or "Return of capital from JVs" (positive)
  - **Business Combinations:** "Acquisition of subsidiaries" or "Business combinations" (negative)
  - **Total CFI:** "Net cash used in investing activities" (for reconciliation)
- **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT include sustaining CAPEX here - that's already in ACFO components
- **Sign Convention:** Outflows are negative, inflows are positive (as shown in cash flow statement)

**Cash Flow from Financing Activities (OPTIONAL - for AFCF coverage analysis):**
- Look in the "FINANCING ACTIVITIES" section of the cash flow statement
- Extract the following (use NEGATIVE for outflows, POSITIVE for inflows):
  - **Debt Principal Repayments:** "Repayment of mortgages" or "Principal payments on debt" (negative)
  - **New Debt Issuances:** "Proceeds from mortgages" or "Issuance of debentures" (positive)
  - **Distributions - Common:** "Distributions to unitholders" or "Dividends paid" (negative)
  - **Distributions - Preferred:** "Distributions on preferred units" (negative, if separate line)
  - **Distributions - NCI:** "Distributions to non-controlling interests" (negative, if separate line)
  - **Equity Issuances:** "Issuance of units" or "Proceeds from equity" (positive)
  - **Unit Buybacks:** "Repurchase of units" or "Unit buyback" (negative)
  - **Deferred Financing Costs:** "Deferred financing costs paid" (negative)
  - **Total CFF:** "Net cash from (used in) financing activities" (for reconciliation)
- **Note:** Some statements combine all distributions into one line - extract as `distributions_common`
- **Sign Convention:** Outflows are negative, inflows are positive (as shown in statement)

### Step 4: Validation

After extraction, check:
- ✓ All REQUIRED fields present
- ✓ Numbers are integers (no commas)
- ✓ Decimals for rates (0.878 not 87.8)
- ✓ Balance sheet reasonably balances
- ✓ Interest expense is POSITIVE
- ✓ Occupancy between 0.0-1.0

### Step 5: Save JSON

Save to: `Issuer_Reports/phase1b/extractions/obs1_HR_Q4_2022_extracted_data.json`

### Step 6: Validate Schema

Run validation:
```bash
python scripts/validate_extraction_schema.py Issuer_Reports/phase1b/extractions/obs1_HR_Q4_2022_extracted_data.json
```

Fix any errors before proceeding to Phase 3.
