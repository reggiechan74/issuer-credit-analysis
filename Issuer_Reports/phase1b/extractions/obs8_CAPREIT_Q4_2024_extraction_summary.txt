NOI Margin Check: ✅ PASSED
  - NOI Margin: 67.7% (strong for residential sector)

Occupancy Check: ✅ PASSED
  - 98% occupancy (excellent for residential)

Dilution Check: ✅ PASSED
  - Dilution: 0.61% (minimal - normal equity compensation)

Data Quality: MODERATE
  - Completeness: Moderate (some values estimated due to PDF table conversion issues)
  - Key metrics confirmed from multiple sources in document
  - CAPREIT uses non-standard terminology ("Normalized FFO" vs standard FFO/AFFO)

==================================================================
SPECIAL NOTES
==================================================================

1. DISTRIBUTION CUT CONTEXT:
   - This observation captures CAPREIT immediately before an 84.5% distribution cut
   - Cut announced in January 2025, effective for distributions after Q4 2024
   - Reported distributions per unit ($0.1902) reflect PRE-CUT annualized rate
   - Post-cut distribution would be approximately $0.0295/unit (84.5% reduction)
   - This makes CAPREIT a key "treatment" case in Phase 1B training dataset

2. TERMINOLOGY DIFFERENCES:
   - CAPREIT uses "Normalized FFO" (formerly NFFO) instead of standard FFO
   - Reports ACFO but NOT AFFO per REALPAC guidelines
   - Some REALPAC adjustments may be bundled differently

3. EUROPEAN OPERATIONS:
   - Significant European exposure through ERES (European Residential REIT)
   - EUR-denominated mortgages and assets
   - Cross-currency interest rate swaps in place
   - Non-controlling interests from ERES units classified as liabilities

4. PORTFOLIO REPOSITIONING STRATEGY:
   - Active capital recycling: Sold 16,859 non-core suites in 2024
   - Acquired 1,286 high-quality suites
   - Net disposition proceeds: $875M+
   - Strategy: Upgrade portfolio quality, reduce geographic/asset concentration

5. NCIB PROGRAM:
   - Normal Course Issuer Bid active in 2024
   - Purchased units for cancellation ($42M spent)
   - Accretive to per-unit metrics

6. CMHC INSURANCE:
   - Heavy use of CMHC-insured mortgages
   - Prepaid CMHC premiums: $110,268k being amortized
   - CMHC write-offs occur on mortgage refinancing

NEXT STEPS
==================================================================

Phase 3: Calculate credit metrics using extracted data
  → Leverage ratios, coverage ratios, AFCF, burn rate analysis

Phase 4: Credit analysis (issuer_due_diligence_expert_slim agent)
  → Analyze factors leading to 84.5% distribution cut
  → Assess sustainability of remaining distribution
  → Portfolio repositioning impact on credit quality

Phase 5: Generate final credit opinion report
  → Comprehensive analysis of CAPREIT's credit profile
  → Distribution cut implications for creditworthiness

Model Training (Issue #38):
  → Use as "treatment" observation in distribution cut prediction model
  → 84.5% cut magnitude provides strong signal for model
  → Feature analysis: Why did CAPREIT cut so aggressively?
