## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

**Indicative Credit Rating:** Ba3 / BB- (Speculative Grade)

RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, Canada's largest retail-focused REIT with $15.4 billion in gross assets and 178 properties totaling 32.3 million square feet, faces **critical liquidity stress** despite maintaining strong operational fundamentals. While the portfolio demonstrates exceptional performance—97.5% occupancy, 19.2% leasing spreads, and stable same-property NOI growth of 2.7%—the REIT's elevated leverage (48.3% Debt/Assets) and material negative free cash flow position create immediate refinancing urgency.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. **Critical Liquidity Risk:** 0.9-month cash runway requires immediate capital markets access
2. **Elevated Leverage:** Debt/Assets of 48.3% sits at upper Ba range amid active deleveraging
3. **Weak Coverage:** NOI/Interest coverage of 1.32x provides minimal cushion
4. **Strong Operations:** Market-leading 97.5% occupancy and 19.2% leasing spreads demonstrate portfolio quality

---

## Credit Strengths

### 2.1 Market-Leading Operational Performance
- **Portfolio occupancy of 97.5%** (committed: 98.2% retail) exceeds peer average and demonstrates strong tenant demand
- **Exceptional leasing spreads of 19.2%** (Q2 2025 vs Q2 2024: 14.5%) reflect pricing power in necessity-based retail
- **Rent per square foot of $22.86** (up from $22.03 YoY) indicates favorable market positioning
- **Same-property NOI growth of 2.7%** demonstrates stable organic growth despite challenging retail environment

### 2.2 High-Quality Necessity-Based Portfolio
- **44.2% essential categories:** 20.2% grocery/pharmacy/liquor + 24.1% essential goods/services create recession-resistant cash flows
- **Geographic concentration in major markets:** 85%+ of gross rent from Canada's six major markets (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa, Edmonton) provides demographic advantage
- **Strong trade areas:** Average population of 276,000 and household income of $156,000 within 5km radius significantly exceed Canadian averages
- **Investment-grade tenant base:** Anchored by Loblaws, Sobeys, Metro, Canadian Tire, with minimal single-tenant concentration

### 2.3 Strategic Asset Base with Densification Potential
- **178 properties** predominantly located in densely populated urban/suburban nodes with long-term redevelopment optionality
- **Mixed-use development pipeline** provides growth opportunities as retail fundamentals stabilize
- **Unencumbered asset pool of $9.0 billion** (up from $8.2B at Q4 2024) provides significant financial flexibility and refinancing capacity

### 2.4 Minimal Equity Dilution Risk
- **Zero dilution** from convertible securities or equity compensation (basic units = diluted units = 296,093)
- **Enhanced governance disclosure** demonstrates transparency in capital structure
- No convertible debt overhang provides certainty on equity structure

### 2.5 Active Deleveraging Program
- **$1.8 billion capital recycling program** (2025-2026) targets debt reduction and balance sheet improvement
- **$354.5M completed to date** (19.7% of target) through non-core asset sales and construction loan repayments
- **Stated goal:** Reduce Adjusted Debt/EBITDA to 8.0-8.5x range (from 8.88x in Q2 2025)

---

---

## Credit Challenges

### 3.1 Critical Liquidity Position
- **Cash runway of 0.9 months** (available cash $72.3M vs monthly burn rate $84.2M) creates immediate refinancing dependency
- **Extended runway of 14.6 months** (including $1.16B undrawn credit facilities) provides temporary cushion but requires covenant maintenance
- **AFCF self-funding ratio of 0.23x** indicates REIT can only cover 23% of mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions) from free cash flow
- **Negative AFCF capacity of $504.9M** (annualized) requires continuous capital markets access for refinancing

### 3.2 Elevated Leverage and Weak Coverage
- **Debt/Assets of 48.3%** sits at the upper end of Ba category (Ba range: 45-55%), limiting financial flexibility
- **Net Debt/Assets of 47.9%** demonstrates minimal cash position relative to debt burden
- **NOI/Interest coverage of 1.32x** is well below investment grade standards (BBB: 3.0-4.0x) and provides minimal cushion for NOI decline
- **Adjusted Debt/EBITDA of 8.88x** significantly exceeds investment grade levels (BBB: 6.0-8.0x)

### 3.3 Material FFO/AFFO Calculation Variances
- **FFO variance of 87.9%** (calculated $260.2M vs reported $138.5M) driven primarily by equity-accounted adjustments (+$199.3M)
- **AFFO variance of 127.8%** (calculated $271.1M vs reported $119.0M) suggests material methodology differences in reserve approach vs actual capex
- **Per-unit metrics significantly diverge:** Calculated FFO of $0.88/unit vs reported $0.47/unit raises questions about joint venture treatment consistency
- While variances don't necessarily indicate misstatement, the magnitude warrants detailed reconciliation with management

### 3.4 Capital Recycling Execution Risk
- **$1.45 billion remaining** of $1.8B program (80.3%) must be completed over 2025-2026 to achieve leverage targets
- **Market-dependent:** Asset sale pricing and timing contingent on real estate market conditions and buyer demand
- **RioCan Living monetization:** Residential rental portfolio disposition requires favorable multifamily cap rates
- **Condo completion risk:** Remaining condo units require market absorption at IFRS values

---

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: NEGATIVE**

**Rationale:**

The Negative outlook reflects RioCan's **critical near-term liquidity position** and **elevated execution risk** on its $1.8 billion capital recycling program. While the REIT's operational fundamentals remain strong and management has demonstrated progress ($354.5M completed), the compressed timeline and challenging real estate market environment create meaningful downside risk.

**Key Monitoring Factors:**
1. **Quarterly capital recycling progress:** Must average $180-240M/quarter over next 6 quarters to meet 2026 target
2. **Covenant compliance:** Maintain credit facility covenants to preserve $1.16B liquidity backstop
3. **Coverage trends:** NOI/Interest coverage must stabilize above 1.30x to offset leverage concerns
4. **Market conditions:** Cap rate environment and buyer appetite for retail assets will dictate execution speed

**Outlook could stabilize to STABLE if:**
- Capital recycling accelerates to $500M+ over next 6 months
- Debt/Assets declines below 45% (mid-Ba range)
- Cash runway extends beyond 24 months on sustained basis
- NOI/Interest coverage improves toward 1.50x

---



**Stabilization Criteria:** Not specified

---

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

A **one-notch upgrade to Ba2 / BB** would require:

### Quantitative Thresholds:
- **Debt/Assets ≤ 43%** (mid-Ba range with improving trend)
- **NOI/Interest coverage ≥ 1.50x** (provides meaningful cushion)
- **AFCF self-funding ratio ≥ 0.40x** (demonstrates reduced capital markets dependency)
- **Cash runway ≥ 24 months** (eliminates near-term liquidity concerns)
- **Capital recycling ≥ $900M completed** (50%+ program completion demonstrates execution capability)

### Qualitative Improvements:
- **Successful RioCan Living disposition** at/above IFRS values demonstrates asset quality validation
- **Credit facility renewal** on favorable terms with increased capacity
- **Distribution coverage improvement** with FFO payout ratio declining to 55-58% range
- **Stable occupancy ≥ 97%** maintained through economic cycle

**Probability Assessment:** Moderate (40-50%) over 18-24 month timeframe if asset sale market remains constructive and management executes on schedule.

---

---

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

A **one-notch downgrade to B1 / B+** would be triggered by:

### Quantitative Triggers:
- **Debt/Assets > 52%** (crossing into B category)
- **NOI/Interest coverage < 1.20x** (approaching unsustainable levels)
- **Cash runway < 3 months** (excluding facility access, indicating acute distress)
- **Covenant breach or facility draw > 80%** (signals distress borrowing)
- **Capital recycling < $100M per quarter** (off-track for deleveraging targets)

### Qualitative Triggers:
- **Forced asset sales** at material discounts to IFRS values (>10-15% below book)
- **Distribution cut** (would signal management concern about sustainability)
- **Credit facility non-renewal** or materially reduced capacity
- **Loss of key anchor tenants** driving occupancy below 95%
- **Failed refinancing** of material debt maturity

**Probability Assessment:** Moderate-High (35-45%) if capital recycling stalls or real estate market deteriorates materially. The critical liquidity position leaves minimal margin for execution delays.

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Investment Grade | A | Gross assets of $15.4B and 32.3M SF portfolio place RioCan well above $10B threshold for "A" category. Largest retail-focused REIT in Canada. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Good Quality | Baa | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Baa - High-quality necessity-based retail in major Canadian markets with investment-grade tenants. 44.2% essential categories provide stability. **Market Position (12.5%):** Baa - Dominant scale in Canadian retail with favorable demographics (276K pop, $156K HHI within 5km). Sector cyclicality and e-commerce pressure limit to Baa. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Constrained | Ba | Critical liquidity position (0.9mo cash runway) and elevated leverage limit capital markets access. Reliant on asset sales for deleveraging. $1.16B undrawn facilities provide temporary cushion but covenant-dependent. Public market access remains but at higher cost. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Weak | Ba | **Debt/Assets: 48.3%** falls in Ba range (45-55%). **NOI/Interest Coverage: 1.32x** is well below investment grade (BBB: 3.0-4.0x). **AFCF Self-Funding: 0.23x** indicates material capital markets dependency. Metrics are Ba-consistent but at weaker end of range. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | Moderately Aggressive | Ba | Management pursuing deleveraging ($1.8B program) but execution risk remains high. FFO payout ratio of 60.6% is moderate but AFFO payout of 71.2% limits flexibility. Active growth investments ($74M development capex) during deleveraging period signals balanced approach. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Speculative Grade** | **Ba3 / BB-** | **Indicated rating: Ba3 / BB-**. Strong business profile (scale, asset quality) offset by weak leverage/coverage metrics and critical liquidity position. Elevated execution risk on capital recycling program warrants low-Ba positioning until demonstrated progress. |

**Notching Considerations:**
- **-1 notch for liquidity:** Critical 0.9-month cash runway and negative AFCF capacity create near-term refinancing risk
- **+0.5 notch for asset quality:** High-quality portfolio with strong operational metrics provides recovery value support
- **Net positioning:** Low Ba3 / BB- with Negative outlook pending capital recycling execution

## Key Observations

### 8.1 REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**FFO/AFFO Metrics (Issuer-Reported):**
- **FFO per unit of $0.47** (Q2 2025) represents 9.3% YoY growth from $0.43 (Q2 2024)
- **FFO payout ratio of 60.6%** provides moderate distribution coverage (1.65x)
- **AFFO per unit of $0.40** yields AFFO payout ratio of 71.2% (1.40x coverage)
- **Distribution of $0.285/unit** ($1.14 annualized) reflects 20.8% growth over four years, demonstrating commitment to unitholder returns despite deleveraging focus

**ACFO/AFCF Metrics (Calculated):**
- **ACFO of $334.3M** ($1.13/unit) significantly exceeds AFFO, driven by reserve methodology differences
- **ACFO payout ratio of 25.2%** (3.97x coverage) suggests highly conservative distribution policy if ACFO is reliable metric
- **AFCF of $154.5M** ($0.52/unit) after $179.8M net investing outflows demonstrates growth investment activity
- **AFCF distribution coverage of 0.91x** (payout ratio 109.9%) indicates distributions exceed free cash flow—reliance on capital recycling/refinancing

**Reconciliation Concerns:**
The 87.9% FFO variance and 127.8% AFFO variance between issuer-reported and REALPAC-calculated figures warrant detailed analysis:
- **Equity-accounted adjustments of $199.3M** (Adj Q) drive majority of FFO variance
- Suggests RioCan's methodology may consolidate JV earnings differently than REALPAC standard
- **Reserve vs actual methodology:** AFFO uses reserves for capex/TI/LC while REALPAC calculates actual amounts
- **Credit impact:** Issuer-reported metrics are more conservative, which is appropriate for credit analysis, but transparency on methodology critical

### 8.2 Portfolio Quality Assessment

**Occupancy Analysis:**
- **97.5% committed occupancy** (98.2% retail) ranks at upper quartile of retail REIT sector
- **19.2% blending spreads** on renewals/new leases demonstrate significant rental rate momentum
- **Strong retention** combined with rate growth suggests tenant demand significantly exceeds supply
- **Rent per SF growth of 3.8%** (to $22.86) supports NOI growth trajectory

**Same-Property NOI Growth:**
- **2.7% SP-NOI growth** for H1 2025 (2.0% in Q2 2025 alone) demonstrates stable organic growth
- Growth driven by occupancy gains, rental rate increases, and operating leverage
- **Lower than historical:** Pre-pandemic SP-NOI growth typically 3-5% for prime retail; current levels reflect normalization
- **Peer comparison:** In-line with sector average (First Capital: 6.2%; SmartCentres: 4.8%; Crombie: comparable)

**Tenant Diversification:**
- **No single tenant > 4% of rent** based on disclosed mix
- **44.2% necessity-based tenants** (grocery/pharmacy/essential goods) provide downside protection
- **Investment-grade anchors** (Loblaws, Metro, Canadian Tire) reduce credit risk
- **Experiential/QSR exposure of 18%** adds growth but also cyclical sensitivity

### 8.3 Burn Rate and Liquidity Dynamics

**Cash Burn Analysis:**
- **Monthly burn rate of $84.2M** driven by:
  - Debt service: $489.7M annualized ($40.8M/month)
  - Distributions: $169.8M annualized ($14.2M/month)
  - Net investing outflows: $179.8M annualized ($15.0M/month)
  - Less: ACFO generation of $334.3M annualized ($27.9M/month)
  - Net burn: $504.9M annualized ($42.1M/month)

- **Critical near-term position:**
  - Available cash of $72.3M covers only 0.9 months at current burn rate
  - **Immediate reliance on credit facilities** to bridge operating needs
  - Extended runway of 14.6 months assumes undrawn facility access ($1.16B)

**Liquidity Sources:**
- **Credit facilities:** $1.93B limit with $771.6M drawn = $1.16B available (60% undrawn)
- **Unencumbered assets:** $9.0B provides substantial refinancing capacity
- **Asset sale pipeline:** $1.45B remaining in capital recycling program
- **Construction loan repayments:** As condo projects complete, embedded liquidity releases

**Covenant Risk:**
- While specific covenants not disclosed, typical REIT facility covenants include:
  - Maximum Debt/Assets: 60-65% (RioCan at 48.3% has cushion)
  - Minimum interest coverage: 1.50x (RioCan at 1.32x may be tight)
  - Minimum unencumbered assets: Typically 1.5x unsecured debt
- **Recommendation:** Verify covenant cushion quarterly as primary liquidity concern

### 8.4 Capital Recycling Program Assessment

**Program Structure:**
- **Target:** $1.8B over 2025-2026 (18-24 month execution window)
- **Completed to date:** $354.5M (19.7%) as of August 7, 2025
  - Closed dispositions: $230.4M
  - Construction loan repayments: $124.1M
- **Remaining:** $1.45B (80.3%)

**Execution Pace:**
- **Required run rate:** $180-240M per quarter over next 6 quarters
- **Q2 2025 pace:** Approximately $60-100M (below required run rate)
- **Q3 2025 critical:** Must accelerate to $150M+ to stay on track

**Asset Sale Components:**
- **Non-core retail:** Single-tenant, secondary market properties
- **RioCan Living:** Entire residential rental portfolio (multi-building complexes)
- **Condo completions:** Pre-sold inventory completing construction
- **JV asset sales:** Partner buyouts or third-party sales

**Execution Risks:**
- **Cap rate environment:** Rising rates pressure valuations; may require discounts to book
- **Buyer appetite:** Retail assets face investor skepticism despite strong fundamentals
- **RioCan Living pricing:** Multifamily cap rates compressed; disposition timing critical
- **Condo market:** Toronto/Vancouver condo markets show inventory oversupply concerns

**Success Factors:**
- Management track record in prior asset recycling cycles
- High-quality assets should attract institutional buyers
- Unencumbered pool provides flexibility on timing
- Construction loan repayments provide non-discretionary liquidity

³ SmartCentres payout ratio rose 50bps YoY; previously more conservative
⁴ First Capital payout on OFFO basis in Q1 2025; Q2 specific ratio not disclosed
⁵ CT REIT has lowest payout ratio in sector due to Canadian Tire anchor stability
⁶ SmartCentres excludes anchors; total SP-NOI growth lower

### Peer Analysis

**Leverage Positioning:**
- **RioCan's 48.3% Debt/Assets ranks weakest among peers** (4th of 5), exceeding peer average by 560bps
- Only SmartCentres approaches similar leverage (44.2%), but with better coverage metrics
- **CT REIT's 39.8%** represents best-in-class leverage discipline
- RioCan's Debt/EBITDA of 8.88x is elevated but comparable to First Capital (9.0x) and below sector concern levels (>10.0x)

**Coverage and Distribution Policy:**
- **RioCan's FFO payout of 60.6% is conservative** relative to SmartCentres (89.4%) and near peer average (62.7%)
- **CT REIT's 26% payout is outlier** due to Canadian Tire parent relationship and anchor tenant stability
- **AFFO payout of 71.2%** (vs Crombie 75.1%) suggests moderate distribution coverage
- RioCan's distribution policy balances unitholder returns with deleveraging—more conservative than SmartCentres but less than CT REIT

**Operational Performance:**
- **RioCan's 97.5% occupancy is peer-average** (range: 97.2%-98.6%), demonstrating competitive portfolio quality
- **2.7% SP-NOI growth lags peers** (First Capital 6.2%, SmartCentres 4.8%, CT REIT 3.4%), potentially due to conservative revenue recognition or tenant mix
- **19.2% leasing spreads (not in table) likely exceed peers**, suggesting embedded rental growth upside

**Liquidity:**
- **RioCan's $1.23B liquidity is adequate** for $15.4B asset base (8% of assets)
- Comparable to First Capital ($1.0B on smaller base) but below pro-rata scale
- Critical distinction: RioCan's liquidity is 94% credit facility (not cash), creating covenant dependency

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **RioCan operates from position of weakness vs peers:**
   - Highest leverage (48.3% vs 42.7% avg)
   - Weakest coverage (1.32x vs unclear for peers)
   - Most critical liquidity (0.9mo runway vs peers likely >6mo)

2. **Operational parity but financial stress:**
   - Portfolio quality comparable (97.5% occupancy, necessity-based focus)
   - Growth lagging (2.7% vs 4.8% avg SP-NOI)
   - Distribution policy balanced but AFCF coverage weak (0.91x)

3. **Strategic divergence:**
   - RioCan actively deleveraging ($1.8B program)
   - Peers in maintenance/growth mode
   - RioCan's rating disadvantage reflects transition risk

**Implied Rating Differential:**
- **First Capital REIT:** BBB (S&P) / Baa2 (DBRS) - two notches above RioCan
- **Crombie REIT:** BBB stable (Morningstar DBRS per Q2 2025 press release) - two notches above
- **CT REIT:** Likely BBB+ given low leverage and anchor tenant quality - three notches above
- **SmartCentres:** Estimated BBB- given rising payout and leverage - one notch above

**Conclusion:**
RioCan's **Ba3 / BB-** positioning is **appropriate given 5-6% weaker leverage than peers** and **critical liquidity position**. The 1-2 notch discount to investment grade peers reflects execution risk on capital recycling, not portfolio quality. Successful deleveraging could close this gap to BBB- (Baa3) within 18-24 months.

## Profile

**Issuer:** RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust

**Reporting Date:** 2025-06-30

**Report Period:** Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025)

### Company Background

**Corporate Structure:**
- **Legal Name:** RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust
- **Structure:** Open-ended real estate investment trust established under the laws of Ontario
- **Exchange Listing:** Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: REI.UN)
- **Units Outstanding:** 296.1 million (basic and diluted equal - no convertible securities)
- **Market Capitalization:** Approximately $5.2-5.3 billion (based on unit price ~$17.50-18.00)

**Company History and Evolution:**
RioCan, founded in 1993, has evolved into **Canada's largest retail-focused REIT** through a combination of strategic acquisitions, development, and portfolio optimization. The REIT initially focused on power centers and big-box retail in suburban markets, partnering with U.S. retail REITs to bring American concepts to Canada.

**Strategic Transformation (2015-Present):**
- **Portfolio repositioning:** Shifted from secondary/tertiary markets to Canada's six major markets (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa, Edmonton), which now represent 85%+ of gross rent
- **U.S. exit:** Divested entire U.S. portfolio (2015-2018) to concentrate capital in Canadian markets
- **Mixed-use evolution:** Launched "RioCan Living" residential rental platform, developing rental apartments on retail sites
- **Necessity-based focus:** Pivoted toward grocery-anchored and essential services tenants (44.2% of portfolio)

**Recent Corporate Activity:**
- **2023-2024:** Commenced $1.8B capital recycling program to reduce leverage and simplify business
- **2025:** Focusing on retail operations and monetizing RioCan Living residential assets to accelerate deleveraging

**Geographic Footprint:**
As of Q2 2025, RioCan's 178 properties are concentrated in:
- **Ontario:** ~60-65% (Toronto GTA dominates)
- **Western Canada:** ~20-25% (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton)
- **Quebec:** ~10-15% (Montreal primarily)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Largest retail REIT in Canada** by asset size ($15.4B) and GLA (32.3M SF)
- **Urban/suburban trade area focus** with average population of 276,000 and household income of $156,000 within 5km
- **Unencumbered asset pool of $9.0 billion** (58% of gross assets) provides financial flexibility
- **Investment-grade tenant roster** dominated by Loblaws, Sobeys, Metro, Canadian Tire, Walmart, Costco

### Business Strategy

**Current Strategic Priorities (2025-2026):**

### 1. **Balance Sheet Deleveraging (Primary Focus)**
Management has identified **debt reduction as the top strategic priority**, executing a **$1.8 billion capital recycling program** over 2025-2026:
- **Target:** Reduce Adjusted Debt/EBITDA from 8.88x to 8.0-8.5x range
- **Execution:** Non-core retail asset sales, RioCan Living portfolio monetization, condo project completions
- **Progress:** $354.5M completed (19.7%) as of August 2025; $1.45B remaining
- **Rationale:** Improve financial flexibility, reduce refinancing risk, position for future growth investments

### 2. **Business Simplification and Core Focus**
RioCan is **simplifying operations** to focus exclusively on necessity-based retail in major Canadian markets:
- **Exiting residential development:** RioCan Living assets being divested after successful proof-of-concept
- **Disposal of non-core retail:** Single-tenant, secondary market properties being sold
- **Concentration on grocery-anchored assets:** Reinforcing competitive advantage in necessity-based retail
- **Operational efficiency:** Streamlining property management and reducing development overhead

### 3. **Operational Excellence and Leasing Momentum**
Despite financial challenges, RioCan continues to execute operationally:
- **Sustained occupancy at 97.5%+** through active leasing and tenant retention
- **Pricing power demonstrated:** 19.2% leasing spreads in Q2 2025
- **Rent growth focus:** Targeting $23-24/SF portfolio average (from $22.86 current)
- **Tenant mix optimization:** Replacing struggling categories with essential/experiential concepts

### 4. **Conservative Distribution Policy**
RioCan maintains distributions at $0.285/unit per quarter ($1.14 annualized) but **prioritizes balance sheet over distribution growth**:
- **FFO payout of 60.6%** provides moderate cushion for volatility
- **AFFO payout of 71.2%** appropriate given capital recycling focus
- **Future growth contingent on deleveraging success:** Distribution increases unlikely until Debt/Assets < 43%
- **Suspension risk:** Low in base case, moderate in downside scenario

### 5. **Selective Growth and Capital Allocation**
Once deleveraging targets achieved (late 2026+), RioCan's strategy likely shifts to:
- **Resume densification:** Mixed-use development on existing sites with JV equity partners
- **Selective acquisitions:** Opportunistic purchases of grocery-anchored assets in major markets
- **Development pipeline reactivation:** Currently muted ($74M in Q2 2025) but long-term value creator
- **ESG initiatives:** Continue carbon reduction (transit-oriented sites), climate resilience, social impact programs

**Strategic Assessment:**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Clear priorities:** Deleveraging focus is appropriate given financial position
- ✅ **Proven execution capability:** Management has successfully executed prior asset recycling programs (U.S. exit, non-core dispositions)
- ✅ **Operational continuity:** Business simplification doesn't disrupt core retail platform
- ✅ **Unitholder alignment:** Conservative distribution policy balances returns with financial prudence

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ **Execution dependent:** Entire strategy hinges on successful $1.8B capital recycling in 18-24 months
- ⚠️ **Market timing:** Asset sale valuations contingent on buyer appetite and cap rate environment
- ⚠️ **Opportunity cost:** Deleveraging focus may cause RioCan to miss growth opportunities if retail market strengthens
- ⚠️ **Unitholder fatigue:** Four years of modest/no distribution growth may test investor patience

**Credit Implications:**

From a **credit perspective**, RioCan's strategy is **appropriate but high-risk**:
- **Positive:** Deleveraging addresses the primary credit weakness (elevated leverage)
- **Positive:** Business simplification reduces operational complexity and focuses management attention
- **Negative:** Compressed execution timeline creates refinancing risk if program stalls
- **Negative:** Capital markets dependency persists until self-funding achieved (likely 2026+)

**Rating reflects transition risk:** The Ba3 / BB- rating with Negative outlook appropriately captures the **favorable strategic direction but elevated execution uncertainty** over the next 12-18 months. Successful execution warrants upgrade to Ba2 / BB (or higher); stalled progress risks downgrade to B1 / B+.

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** Yes

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the forward-looking speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves based on current run rate. This is a **liquidity stress test** assuming NO future access to capital markets. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions).

**Formula:**
```
Mandatory Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (period amounts)
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period
```

**Note:** New financing is NOT subtracted - burn rate assumes no future capital raises.

**Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Reporting Period | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **AFCF (Period)** | 154,545 | Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025) | Free cash flow |
| **Mandatory Obligations:** | | | |
| - Total Debt Service | 489,668 | Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025) | Interest + Principal |
| - Total Distributions | 169,794 | Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025) | Common + Preferred |
| **Total Obligations** | 659,462 | Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025) | - |
| **Period Deficit/(Surplus)** | -504,917 | Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025) | AFCF - Obligations |
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | -84,153 | Per month | 6-month period |

**Self-Funding Analysis:**
- **Self-Funding Ratio:** 0.23x (AFCF / Mandatory Obligations)
- **Interpretation:** High capital markets reliance
- **Capital Markets Reliance:** Requires $504,917 external financing (77% of obligations)

**Liquidity Position:**

| Liquidity Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Cash and Cash Equivalents** | 72,318 | End of period |
| **Marketable Securities** | 0 | Liquid investments |
| **Less: Restricted Cash** | (0) | Not available for operations |
| **Available Cash** | 72,318 | Immediately available |
| **Undrawn Credit Facilities** | 1,160,358 | Remaining capacity |
| **Total Available Liquidity** | 1,232,676 | Cash + facilities |

**Cash Runway Analysis:**

| Scenario | Liquidity Base | Runway (Months) | Runway (Years) | Depletion Date | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash Only** | 72,318 | 0.9 | 0.1 | 2025-07-25 | CRITICAL |
| **Extended** (w/ facilities) | 1,232,676 | 14.6 | 1.2 | 2026-09-11 | CRITICAL |

**Runway Calculation:**
- **Cash Only:** Available Cash (72,318) ÷ Monthly Burn (84,153) = 0.9 months
- **Extended:** Total Liquidity (1,232,676) ÷ Monthly Burn (84,153) = 14.6 months

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Risk Level | Risk Score | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | CRITICAL | 4/4 | 🚨 Critical Risk - Immediate financing required (< 6 months) |

**Risk Thresholds:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (Score 4): < 6 months runway - Immediate financing required
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (Score 3): 6-12 months runway - Near-term capital raise needed
- ⚠️ **MODERATE** (Score 2): 12-24 months runway - Plan financing within 12 months
- ✓ **LOW** (Score 1): > 24 months runway - Adequate liquidity runway

**Warning Flags:**
None identified

**Recommendations:**
- Suspend or reduce distributions immediately
- Accelerate non-core asset sales
- Pursue emergency financing (bridge loan, equity raise)
- Defer all non-critical capital expenditures
- Engage restructuring advisors

**Sustainable Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Target Runway** | 24 months | Management target |
| **Sustainable Monthly Burn** | 3,013 | Maximum sustainable burn rate |
| **Actual Monthly Burn** | -84,153 | Current burn rate |
| **Excess/(Deficit) Burn** | 81,140 | Above sustainable - Overspending by $81,140/month |

**Burn Rate Interpretation:**
AFCF of $154,545 covers 23% of mandatory obligations ($659,462). Monthly cash deficit of $84,153 must be funded through capital markets or asset sales.

**Credit Implications:**
🚨 Critical - High dependence on capital markets and undrawn credit facilities

#### 4.4 Liquidity Assessment

Based on available metrics, the issuer demonstrates weak liquidity with 1.32x interest coverage. Detailed liquidity analysis requires review of debt maturity schedule and available credit facilities.

**ACFO/AFCF Coverage of Cash Needs:**
- ACFO provides 3.96xx coverage of distributions
- AFCF provides 1.83x coverage of total financing needs
- After distributions, residual ACFO available: Not available CAD thousands
- After all financing, residual AFCF available: Not available CAD thousands
- Sufficient to cover: NOI/Interest coverage of 1.32x is below typical REIT minimum (2.0x)

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case (50-60% probability)
**"Successful Deleveraging with Asset Sale Headwinds"**

**Assumptions:**
- Capital recycling achieves $1.1-1.3B over next 12 months (60-70% of target)
- Asset sales at 5-7% discount to IFRS book value due to cap rate expansion
- RioCan Living disposition achieves $400-500M at 4.5-5.0% cap rates
- Occupancy stable at 96-97% with continued positive leasing spreads (12-15%)
- SP-NOI growth moderates to 2.0-2.5% as rate growth offsets minor occupancy softness
- Interest expense stable (no major refinancings at materially higher rates in period)
- Distributions maintained at current $0.285/unit per quarter

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 43-45% (from 48.3%) - decline of 300-500bps through $1.2B debt reduction
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 7.5-8.0x (from 8.88x) - approaching investment grade range
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 1.40-1.50x (from 1.32x) - modest improvement as EBITDA stabilizes and debt service declines
- **Cash runway:** 18-24 months (from 0.9mo) - dramatically improved through asset sale proceeds
- **AFCF self-funding ratio:** 0.35-0.45x (from 0.23x) - improved but still capital markets dependent

**Rating Impact:** **STABLE OUTLOOK** - Ba3 maintained with potential upgrade to Ba2 in 18-24 months if full program execution achieved. Asset sale headwinds absorbed but progress sufficient to stabilize credit profile.

**Key Monitoring Points:**
- Quarterly asset sale volume must average $100-120M (Q3-Q4 2025 critical)
- Covenant cushion maintained above 10% on all credit facility tests
- Distribution coverage sustained above 1.35x AFFO coverage

---

### Upside Case (20-30% probability)
**"Accelerated Deleveraging with Favorable Markets"**

**Assumptions:**
- Capital recycling exceeds target: $1.6-1.8B over next 12 months (90-100% completion)
- Asset sales at/above book value as retail investor sentiment improves
- RioCan Living achieves premium pricing: $600-700M at 4.0-4.5% cap rates
- Occupancy improves to 98%+ with sustained leasing spreads of 15-20%
- SP-NOI growth accelerates to 3.5-4.5% driven by rate increases and occupancy gains
- Distribution increase of 3-5% demonstrates confidence and improves unitholder sentiment
- Successful credit facility renewal with increased capacity ($2.5B) and improved pricing

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 39-41% (from 48.3%) - investment grade range (Baa: 35-45%)
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 6.5-7.0x (from 8.88x) - solid investment grade positioning
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 1.60-1.80x (from 1.32x) - approaching lower Baa range
- **Cash runway:** 36+ months - comfortable liquidity cushion eliminates near-term concerns
- **AFCF self-funding ratio:** 0.60-0.70x (from 0.23x) - reduced capital markets dependency

**Rating Impact:** **UPGRADE TO Ba1 / BB+** with **POSITIVE OUTLOOK** toward Baa3 / BBB-. Successful execution de-risks credit profile and positions for investment grade restoration within 12-18 months.

**Upgrade Path to Baa3 / BBB- (Investment Grade):**
Requires sustained performance over 18-24 months:
- Debt/Assets ≤ 40% maintained
- NOI/Interest Coverage ≥ 2.0x achieved through NOI growth or debt reduction
- Cash runway > 24 months sustained
- Distribution policy remains conservative (FFO payout ≤ 60%)
- No covenant concerns or liquidity stress incidents

**Probability Assessment:** 20-30% likelihood depends heavily on real estate market recovery and investor appetite for retail assets. RioCan's portfolio quality supports premium valuations, but market timing is uncertain.

---

### Downside Case (10-20% probability)
**"Stalled Capital Recycling with Market Deterioration"**

**Assumptions:**
- Capital recycling stalls: Only $400-600M achieved over next 12 months (22-33% of target)
- Asset sales require material discounts: 12-18% below book value as retail cap rates expand
- RioCan Living disposition delayed or repriced lower: $250-350M at 5.5-6.0% cap rates
- Occupancy declines to 95-96% as tenant failures increase (recession scenario)
- SP-NOI contracts -1.0% to 0% due to occupancy loss and tenant concessions
- Interest expense increases 10-15% on refinancings at higher rates
- Distribution maintained initially but under Board review; potential cut to $0.24/unit (15% reduction)

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 49-52% (from 48.3%) - deteriorates toward B range despite some asset sales
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 9.5-10.5x (from 8.88x) - elevated distress territory
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 1.10-1.20x (from 1.32x) - dangerously low coverage
- **Cash runway:** 3-6 months - acute liquidity stress without facility access
- **AFCF self-funding ratio:** 0.10-0.15x (from 0.23x) - severe capital markets dependency

**Rating Impact:** **DOWNGRADE TO B1 / B+** with **NEGATIVE OUTLOOK**. Credit profile deteriorates materially as deleveraging stalls and operating environment weakens. Forced asset sales at distressed pricing and/or distribution cut likely.

**Downgrade Triggers:**
- Debt/Assets > 52% (entering B category)
- NOI/Interest Coverage < 1.15x (unsustainable)
- Covenant breach or facility draw > 85% (distress borrowing)
- Distribution cut implemented (loss of credibility)
- Asset sales < $100M per quarter for two consecutive quarters

**Mitigation Actions Required:**
- Emergency distribution cut to 50-60% of current level ($0.17-0.20/unit)
- Accelerated non-core asset sales at 15-20% discounts to book
- Credit facility amendment/waiver discussions
- Possible equity raise ($300-500M) at dilutive pricing
- Development pipeline suspension to preserve liquidity

**Probability Assessment:** 10-20% likelihood contingent on recession scenario and/or retail real estate market dislocation. RioCan's portfolio quality provides downside protection, but elevated leverage and weak coverage leave limited margin for error.

---

### Stress Case (5-10% probability)
**"Severe Recession with Liquidity Crisis"**

**Assumptions:**
- **Severe economic downturn:** Canadian GDP contracts 2-3%, unemployment rises to 8-9%
- Retail tenant failures accelerate: 10-15% of rent roll (non-grocery categories)
- Occupancy plunges to 90-92% as vacancies rise and renewals decline
- SP-NOI contracts -8% to -12% from base case (combination of occupancy loss, rent concessions, higher OpEx)
- Capital recycling fails: Only $100-200M achieved as buyer liquidity evaporates
- Asset sales require fire-sale pricing: 25-35% discounts to book value
- Credit facility renewal difficult: Covenant relief required, capacity reduced 20-30%
- Interest expense rises 20-30% on refinancings due to credit spread widening
- Distribution suspended entirely to preserve liquidity

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 58-65% (from 48.3%) - severe deterioration as asset values decline and debt reduction stalls
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 13-16x (from 8.88x) - distressed territory
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 0.80-1.00x (from 1.32x) - insufficient to cover interest
- **Cash runway:** < 3 months - imminent liquidity crisis
- **AFCF self-funding ratio:** Negative (from 0.23x) - AFCF turns deeply negative

**Rating Impact:** **DOWNGRADE TO B3 / B-** or lower with **NEGATIVE / DEVELOPING OUTLOOK**. Credit profile severely impaired with going concern risk. Restructuring scenarios (debt amendment, DIP financing, asset liquidation) likely.

**Crisis Management Actions:**
- **Distribution suspension** (saves $170M annually)
- **Fire-sale asset dispositions** at 25-35% discounts ($500-700M proceeds)
- **Equity raise at deep discount** ($200-300M at 40-50% discount to NAV)
- **Credit facility waiver/amendment** with enhanced covenants and higher pricing
- **Strategic alternatives review:** Portfolio JV, merger, take-private transaction
- **Development pipeline monetization:** Sell land parcels or bring in JV equity partners
- **Operating expense reduction:** Staff cuts, G&A reductions, suspend non-critical capex

**Downward Spiral Risk:**
- Asset sales at distressed pricing → Lower NAV → Equity value destruction → Difficulty raising equity
- Covenant breach → Facility revocation → Liquidity crisis → Forced asset sales
- Distribution suspension → Unit price collapse → Equity raise highly dilutive → Unitholder confidence loss
- Tenant failures accelerate → Occupancy declines → NOI falls → Coverage deteriorates further

**Recovery Scenarios:**
Even in stress case, RioCan's asset quality provides eventual recovery value:
- **Liquidation value:** Assuming fire-sale at 30% discount to book, assets worth $10.8B vs debt of $7.4B → Unitholder recovery of $3.4B ($11.48/unit) vs current unit price ~$17-18
- **Debt holders well-secured:** 48% LTV even at distressed pricing provides substantial recovery (>80-90%)
- **Going concern value exceeds liquidation:** Portfolio quality and major market locations support higher valuations in recovery

**Probability Assessment:** 5-10% likelihood requires severe recession combined with systemic retail sector stress. RioCan's necessity-based focus (44% essential categories) and investment-grade tenant base provide meaningful downside protection. More likely scenario is Downside Case (10-20%) rather than full Stress Case.

### Downgrade Trigger Summary

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer | Risk Level |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | > 52% | 48.3% | 7.7% / 370bps | MODERATE |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | < 1.15x | 1.32x | 14.8% | MODERATE |
| **Cash Runway** | < 3 months | 0.9 months | BREACHED | **CRITICAL** |
| **Covenant - Debt/Assets** | > 60-65%¹ | 48.3% | 24-34% | LOW |
| **Covenant - Int Coverage** | < 1.50x¹ | 1.32x | -12%² | **HIGH** |
| **Capital Recycling Pace** | < $100M/qtr | ~$120M/qtr³ | MINIMAL | MODERATE |

¹ Estimated covenant thresholds; actual covenants not publicly disclosed
² Negative buffer indicates current metric may be below covenant threshold; likely has temporary relief or different calculation
³ Based on $354.5M completed in ~3 quarters; pace must accelerate to $180-240M/qtr for full program

**Most Critical Triggers (Next 6-12 months):**
1. **Cash runway < 3 months** - Already breached; reliant on credit facility access
2. **Interest coverage covenant breach** - May be operating with tight cushion or temporary waiver
3. **Capital recycling < $100M per quarter** - Currently marginally above; must accelerate
4. **Debt/Assets > 52%** - Moderate buffer but could deteriorate quickly if asset sales stall

**Quarterly Monitoring Essential:**
Given critical liquidity position and compressed timeline for capital recycling, **quarterly covenant compliance and asset sale progress are essential monitoring points**. Any deterioration in these metrics would trigger immediate rating review for downgrade.

## ESG Considerations

### ESG Credit Impact Score: CIS-3 (Neutral-to-Low)

### Environmental Factors (E-3)

While this credit analysis focuses on financial and operational metrics, **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors** increasingly influence real estate credit quality:

### Environmental Factors
- **Climate resilience:** RioCan's urban/transit-oriented portfolio has lower climate transition risk than suburban/car-dependent retail
- **Energy efficiency:** Necessity-based retail (grocery) requires higher energy usage; carbon reduction targets important for long-term competitiveness
- **Physical risk:** Canadian properties face moderate climate risks (winter storms, flooding in some markets); portfolio diversification mitigates concentration

**Credit Impact:** Neutral to slightly positive. RioCan's major market focus provides long-term resilience, but near-term capex for sustainability may compete with deleveraging priorities.

### Social Factors
- **Community impact:** Necessity-based retail serves essential daily needs; positive social value
- **Tenant mix:** Essential services (grocery, pharmacy, medical) provide public benefit
- **Labor practices:** Property management and leasing operations; no material concerns identified

**Credit Impact:** Neutral. RioCan's focus on essential retail provides social license stability.

### Governance Factors
- **Board oversight:** Appears effective based on strategic clarity and disclosure quality
- **Management incentives:** Likely tied to leverage reduction and unitholder returns (alignment with credit priorities)
- **Disclosure quality:** Enhanced disclosure on dilution, liquidity, and capital recycling demonstrates transparency
- **Related party:** No material related-party concerns identified

**Credit Impact:** Slightly positive. Governance quality supports execution of deleveraging strategy.

**ESG Rating Estimate:** RioCan would likely receive **ESG-2** or **ESG-3** rating (on 1-5 scale, with 1 being most positive), indicating ESG factors are **neutral to credit quality** but not a primary rating driver at this time.

### Key Limitations

1. **Single Point-in-Time Analysis:** Based on Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025) data only
2. **Limited Historical Data:** Trend analysis requires multi-period data
3. **No Management Guidance:** Forward-looking assumptions not validated by management
4. **Incomplete Debt Schedule:** Maturity profile and covenant details not reviewed
5. **No Market Comparables:** Peer analysis not performed
6. **Limited ESG Data:** Property-level environmental and social metrics not available
7. **Forward-Looking Uncertainty:** Scenario analysis based on assumptions that may not materialize

### Professional Caveats

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:**

- This is credit analysis, **NOT investment advice**
- Final rating decisions require credit committee review and approval
- Analysis based on data from a single reporting period
- Forward-looking statements involve uncertainty and assumptions
- Professional review by qualified credit analysts recommended before any credit decision
- This analysis should not be relied upon as the sole basis for credit decisions
- Additional due diligence required for investment-grade rating confirmation

## Appendix B: Moody's-Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

Not available

---

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

**Total Debt Service:**
```
Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Where:
  Annualized Interest = Interest expense for the reporting period (annualized)
  Principal Repayments = Scheduled principal payments for the reporting period

Note: Period amounts should be consistent (e.g., all quarterly or all annual)
```

**NOI / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
NOI / Debt Service Coverage = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight debt service coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient debt service coverage
```

**EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage = EBITDA / Total Debt Service

Where:
  EBITDA = NOI (for REITs, NOI approximates EBITDA)
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Note: For REITs, NOI/Debt Service and EBITDA/Debt Service are equivalent
```

**FFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
FFO / Debt Service Coverage = FFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.5x = Strong coverage
  ≥ 2.0x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Moderate coverage
  < 1.5x = Weak coverage
```

**AFFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFFO / Debt Service Coverage = AFFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong coverage (significant cushion after sustaining capex)
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient coverage
```

**ACFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
ACFO / Debt Service Coverage = ACFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.5x = Strong coverage (cash flow based)
  ≥ 1.25x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (cannot cover debt service from operating cash)
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**
```
FFO = IFRS Net Income
    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```

**AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow):**
```
AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Where:
  ACFO = Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (per REALPAC 2023)
  Net CFI = Cash Flow from Investing Activities (IFRS statement)
            Including: Development CAPEX, acquisitions/dispositions,
                      JV capital contributions/returns

IMPORTANT - Double-Counting Prevention:
  ACFO already deducts:
    - Sustaining CAPEX (Adjustment 4)
    - Sustaining TI (Adjustment 6)
    - External leasing costs (Adjustment 5)

  CFI should ONLY include:
    - Development/growth CAPEX (NOT sustaining)
    - Property acquisitions and dispositions
    - JV capital contributions/returns (NOT distributions)
    - Business combinations
```

**AFCF Per Unit:**
```
AFCF per Unit (Basic) = AFCF / Common Units Outstanding (weighted average)

AFCF per Unit (Diluted) = AFCF / Diluted Units Outstanding (weighted average)

Where:
  Diluted Units = Basic Units + Dilutive Instruments
  Dilutive Instruments = RSUs + DSUs + Options + Convertible Debt + Warrants
```

### AFCF Coverage Metrics

**AFCF Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFCF Debt Service Coverage = AFCF / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (can cover debt service from free cash flow)
  < 1.0x = Reliant on capital markets for debt service
```

**AFCF Payout Ratio:**
```
AFCF Payout Ratio = (Total Distributions / AFCF) × 100

Assessment Thresholds:
  < 100% = Distributions sustainable from free cash flow
  ≥ 100% = Distributions exceed free cash flow
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Ratio:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Where:
  Total Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (per reporting period)

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no capital markets reliance)
  0.8-1.0x = Low reliance on external financing
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate reliance on capital markets
  < 0.5x = High reliance on capital markets

Note: Does NOT subtract new financing - measures inherent cash generation capacity
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Capacity:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Capacity = AFCF - (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Interpretation:
  Positive = Surplus cash after all financing obligations
  Negative = Deficit requiring external financing
```

### Burn Rate and Cash Runway Metrics

**Burn Rate Applicability:**
```
Burn Rate applies when: AFCF < Total Financing Obligations

Where:
  Total Financing Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions

Note: A REIT can have positive AFCF but still burn cash if free cash flow
      is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations.
```

**Monthly Burn Rate:**
```
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period

Where:
  Mandatory Obligations = Total Debt Service + Total Distributions
  New financing is NOT subtracted (assumes no future capital raises)
```

**Self-Funding Ratio (Burn Rate Context):**
```
Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / Mandatory Obligations

Interpretation:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no burn rate - generates surplus)
  0.8-1.0x = Low burn rate (nearly self-funding)
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate burn rate (moderate capital markets reliance)
  < 0.5x = High burn rate (high capital markets reliance)
```

**Cash Runway:**
```
Available Cash = Cash + Marketable Securities - Restricted Cash

Cash Runway (months) = Available Cash / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Extended Runway = (Available Cash + Undrawn Facilities) / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Where:
  Undrawn Facilities = Remaining credit facility capacity
  |Monthly Burn Rate| = Absolute value of monthly burn rate
```

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**
```
Risk Level based on Cash Runway:
  < 6 months    = CRITICAL (Score 4) - Immediate financing required
  6-12 months   = HIGH (Score 3) - Near-term capital raise needed
  12-24 months  = MODERATE (Score 2) - Plan financing within 12 months
  > 24 months   = LOW (Score 1) - Adequate liquidity runway
```

**Sustainable Burn Rate:**
```
Target Runway = 24 months (default)
Sustainable Monthly Burn = Available Cash / Target Runway

Excess Burn = Actual Monthly Burn - Sustainable Monthly Burn

Status:
  Excess Burn < 0 = Below sustainable (cash cushion)
  Excess Burn > 0 = Above sustainable (corrective action needed)
```

### Coverage Quality Assessment

**Distribution Coverage Assessment:**
```
Coverage Quality (applies to FFO/AFFO/ACFO/AFCF coverage):

  ≥ 1.3x = Strong coverage (30%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.1x = Adequate coverage (10%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage (< 10% cushion)
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (distributions exceed metric)
```

**Payout Ratio Assessment:**
```
Payout Ratio Quality (inverse of coverage):

  ≤ 77% = Strong (< 77% payout = 1.3x+ coverage)
  ≤ 91% = Adequate (< 91% payout = 1.1x+ coverage)
  < 100% = Tight (< 100% payout = 1.0x+ coverage)
  ≥ 100% = Insufficient (payout exceeds metric)
```
