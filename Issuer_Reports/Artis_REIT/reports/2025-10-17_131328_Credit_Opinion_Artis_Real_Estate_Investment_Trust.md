# Credit Opinion: Artis Real Estate Investment Trust

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Reporting Period:** Unknown
**Currency:** CAD

---

## Executive Summary

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust presents a **Ba/BB credit profile** characterized by elevated leverage (41.3% Debt/Gross Assets), weak interest coverage (1.81x NOI/Interest), and significant near-term refinancing risk with 38% of mortgages maturing in the remainder of 2025. The REIT is executing a portfolio rationalization strategy that has resulted in substantial revenue declines (-30.3% Q2 YoY) and a $26 million expected credit loss on preferred investments. However, operational performance remains resilient with 18 consecutive quarters of renewal rent growth (+3.6% Q2), improving occupancy (87.8%, 89.0% including commitments), and positive same-property NOI growth (+2.3% YTD). The REIT's conservative AFFO payout ratio (37.5%) provides modest financial flexibility, but fully drawn credit facilities and upcoming debt maturities constrain liquidity. The credit profile is transitioning as the REIT reshapes its portfolio, creating execution risk alongside potential for eventual deleveraging.

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2/BB (consistent with DBRS BB (high) rating)

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. **Elevated leverage and weak coverage** - Debt/Assets of 41.3% and NOI/Interest coverage of 1.81x place the REIT in Ba/BB territory
2. **Significant near-term refinancing risk** - 38% of mortgages mature in 2025 with credit facilities fully drawn
3. **Resilient operational performance** - Positive same-property NOI growth and consistent renewal rent increases demonstrate underlying asset quality
4. **Portfolio transition execution risk** - Large credit losses and revenue declines reflect active disposition strategy

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook Assessment:** The **Stable** outlook reflects our expectation that Artis will successfully navigate 2025 debt maturities through a combination of refinancings and selective asset sales, maintaining leverage in the 40-45% range and coverage above 1.75x. The outlook assumes:

1. **Successful refinancing of 2025 mortgage maturities** (~$244M) without material disruption
2. **Asset sales of $50-100M** from held-for-sale portfolio to reduce credit facility borrowings
3. **Stable to modestly positive same-property NOI performance** continuing recent trends
4. **No additional material credit losses** on preferred investments beyond recognized amounts
5. **Maintenance of conservative AFFO payout ratio** (35-45%)

**Upside Scenario (10% probability):**
A Positive outlook would require accelerated deleveraging through successful asset dispositions at or above book value, reducing Debt/Gross Assets below 38% and improving NOI/Interest coverage above 2.25x. This would demonstrate stronger market access and execution capability than currently evident.

**Downside Scenario (20% probability):**
A Negative outlook would result from refinancing difficulties forcing distressed asset sales, additional credit losses, or coverage deterioration below 1.5x. Inability to refinance 2025 maturities or asset sales at significant discounts to book value would pressure the rating.

**Key Outlook Drivers:**
- **2025 refinancing execution:** Most critical near-term factor
- **Asset disposition pace and pricing:** Need to demonstrate market validation of NAV
- **Coverage trajectory:** NOI stability vs. interest expense evolution
- **Credit facility management:** Ability to reduce drawings and restore liquidity cushion

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Factor 1: Scale (Weight: 5%)

| Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Small Scale** | **4 (Weak)** | Gross assets of $2.61 billion position Artis as a small-cap REIT well below the $5 billion threshold for Baa/BBB scale. Asset base has contracted significantly from prior periods due to disposition activity. Limited scale reduces diversification, market access, and negotiating power with lenders. |

**Key Metrics:**
- Gross Assets: $2,611,435 (< $5B threshold for investment grade scale)
- Investment Properties: $2,025,831
- Properties Held for Sale: $232,752 (8.9% of gross assets)

---

### Factor 2: Business Profile (Weight: 25%)

#### Sub-factor 2A: Asset Quality & Portfolio Composition (12.5%)

| Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Adequate Quality, Operational Resilience** | **3 (Adequate)** | Portfolio demonstrates solid operational performance with 18 consecutive quarters of renewal rent growth (+3.6% Q2 2025) and positive same-property NOI growth (+2.3% YTD). Occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% including commitments) is below the NAREIT office/retail composite average of ~91% but shows sequential improvement. Active disposition of non-core assets and expected credit loss of $26M Q2 on preferred investments indicate prior capital allocation challenges. |

**Key Metrics:**
- Occupancy: 87.8% (89.0% including commitments)
- Same Property NOI Growth: +2.3% YTD
- Renewal Rent Growth: +3.6% Q2 (18 consecutive quarters)
- Q2 Leasing Activity: 337K SF (126K new, 211K renewals)

#### Sub-factor 2B: Market Position & Competitive Dynamics (12.5%)

| Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Weak Market Position** | **4 (Weak)** | Limited disclosure on geographic and asset class diversification, but small scale and contracting asset base suggest limited market power. Revenue decline of 30.3% Q2 YoY and NOI decline of 35.8% reflect significant portfolio churn. Large properties held for sale ($233M, 8.9% of assets) indicate ongoing portfolio rationalization. Units trading at 43% discount to NAV ($7.42 vs $12.98 NAV) signals market skepticism about strategy execution and asset values. |

**Key Metrics:**
- Revenue Decline: -30.3% Q2 YoY, -26.5% YTD
- NOI Decline: -35.8% Q2 YoY, -32.3% YTD
- Properties Held for Sale: $232,752 (8.9% of gross assets)
- Unit Price Discount to NAV: 43% ($7.42 vs $12.98 NAV)

**Business Profile Composite Score:** **3.5 (Weak/Adequate)**

---

### Factor 3: Access to Capital & Liquidity (Weight: 20%)

| Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Constrained Access, Refinancing Risk** | **4 (Weak)** | Credit facilities fully drawn at $437.6M indicate stressed liquidity. With 38% of mortgages maturing in remainder of 2025 and Debt/Adjusted EBITDA at 7.4x, the REIT faces significant refinancing risk in a higher rate environment. Limited asset sales in Q2 ($4.8M single retail property) provide insufficient liquidity generation. Conservative AFFO payout ratio (37.5%) preserves some cash flow, but FFO decline of 37.5% YTD constrains internal capital generation. BB rating limits access to unsecured debt markets. |

**Key Metrics:**
- Credit Facilities Drawn: $437,590 (fully utilized)
- 2025 Mortgage Maturities: 38% of mortgage portfolio
- Debt/Adjusted EBITDA: 7.4x
- Variable Rate Debt: 25.1% (rate risk exposure)
- Q2 Asset Sales: $4,750 (minimal liquidity generation)
- AFFO Payout Ratio: 37.5% (conservative)

**Liquidity Assessment:**
- **Sources:** AFFO of $8.2M quarterly, potential asset sales from $233M held for sale
- **Uses:** Distributions ($3M quarterly), debt maturities (38% in 2025), capex requirements
- **Net Position:** Tight liquidity with heavy reliance on asset sales and refinancing

---

### Factor 4: Leverage & Coverage (Weight: 35%)

#### Sub-factor 4A: Leverage Metrics (17.5%)

| Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Elevated Leverage, Ba Range** | **4 (Weak)** | Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3% (Net Debt 40.7%) sits firmly in Ba/BB territory, at the high end of the 35-45% Baa range and approaching the 45-55% Ba threshold. Debt/Adjusted EBITDA of 7.4x is well above investment grade norms (typically <6.5x). Contracting asset base and declining NOI create negative deleveraging momentum. Equity accounted investments ($107.6M) and properties held for sale ($232.8M) represent 13% of assets, adding complexity to liquidation value assessment. |

**Key Metrics:**
- Debt/Gross Assets: **41.32%** (Ba/BB range: 35-50%)
- Net Debt/Gross Assets: 40.68%
- Total Debt: $1,079,968
- Debt/Adjusted EBITDA: 7.4x (weak for investment grade)

**Debt Structure:**
- Mortgages & Loans: $641,422 (59% of debt)
- Credit Facilities: $437,590 (41% of debt, fully drawn)
- Variable Rate Exposure: 25.1%

#### Sub-factor 4B: Coverage Ratios (17.5%)

| Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Weak Coverage, Ba Range** | **4 (Weak)** | NOI/Interest coverage of 1.81x is substantially below investment grade thresholds (Baa: 3.0-4.0x) and sits in the lower Ba range (2.0-3.0x). Annualized interest expense of $67.7M against quarterly NOI of $30.7M demonstrates significant interest burden. FFO of $17.0M Q2 covers interest expense by only 1.0x on an FFO basis. Declining NOI (-35.8% Q2 YoY) creates negative coverage trajectory. AFFO payout ratio of 37.5% is conservative, but AFFO itself has declined 46.5% YTD. |

**Key Metrics:**
- **NOI/Interest Coverage: 1.81x** (Ba range: 2.0-3.0x)
- FFO/Interest: ~1.0x (marginal)
- Quarterly Interest Expense: $16,937
- Quarterly NOI: $30,729
- AFFO Payout Ratio: 37.5% (conservative)
- FFO Payout Ratio: 17.6% (very conservative)

**Coverage Trajectory:**
- Q2 2025 FFO: $16,956 (-37.5% YTD)
- Q2 2025 AFFO: $8,204 (-46.5% YTD)
- Declining NOI base pressures coverage metrics

**Leverage & Coverage Composite Score:** **4.0 (Weak)**

---

### Factor 5: Financial Policy & Management Strategy (Weight: 15%)

| Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Moderately Aggressive, Transition Risk** | **3.5 (Adequate/Weak)** | Management is executing a portfolio rationalization strategy involving asset dispositions and unit buybacks via NCIB (3.8M units YTD at $7.42 avg, 43% discount to $12.98 NAV). Strategy is financially logical given NAV discount but creates execution risk and has resulted in $26M Q2 expected credit loss on preferred investments. Conservative AFFO payout ratio (37.5%) demonstrates financial discipline. However, fully drawn credit facilities and weak coverage metrics suggest limited financial flexibility to absorb further stress. Willingness to maintain distributions despite net losses shows commitment to unitholder returns but constrains deleveraging capacity. |

**Key Metrics:**
- AFFO Payout Ratio: 37.5% (conservative distribution policy)
- FFO Payout Ratio: 17.6% (very conservative)
- NCIB Activity: 3.8M units purchased YTD at $7.42 (vs $12.98 NAV)
- Expected Credit Losses: $26M Q2, $34.2M YTD (prior investment decisions)
- Asset Dispositions: Minimal Q2 activity ($4.8M)

**Strategic Assessment:**
- **Positive:** Conservative payout ratios, disciplined unit buybacks at significant NAV discount
- **Concerns:** Slow disposition pace, large credit losses, fully drawn facilities indicate strained financial flexibility

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Assessment

**FFO and AFFO Quality:**
- Q2 FFO of $17.0M ($0.17/unit) translates to $68M annualized run-rate, down 37.5% YTD
- AFFO of $8.2M ($0.08/unit) reflects substantial capex and adjustment items
- Large gap between FFO ($17M) and AFFO ($8M) indicates significant non-discretionary capex/leasing costs
- Declining FFO trajectory creates uncertainty about sustainable distribution capacity

**Distribution Coverage:**
- AFFO payout ratio of 37.5% is very conservative by REIT standards
- FFO payout ratio of 17.6% indicates significant cash retention
- However, absolute AFFO dollars are declining (down 46.5% YTD), limiting retained cash flow
- Conservative ratios provide cushion but don't resolve underlying earnings decline

### Portfolio Quality Indicators

**Occupancy Analysis:**
- 87.8% in-place occupancy below NAREIT sector average of ~91%
- 89.0% including commitments shows 1.2% near-term improvement pipeline
- Sequential improvement from 87.1% demonstrates positive momentum
- Gap to sector average suggests room for improvement but also potential market/asset quality challenges

**Leasing Metrics:**
- Q2 leasing of 337K SF (126K new, 211K renewals) represents ~12-15% of portfolio (assuming 2.2-2.8M SF total)
- 3.6% renewal rent growth in Q2 continues strong trend (18 consecutive quarters)
- New leasing vs renewals split (37% new, 63% renewals) typical for stabilizing portfolio
- Strong leasing fundamentals contrast with elevated credit losses, suggesting losses concentrated in financial investments rather than real estate operations

### Leverage Trend Analysis

**Debt Composition:**
- 59% secured mortgages ($641M) vs 41% credit facilities ($438M) is reasonable mix
- 25.1% variable rate exposure manageable but creates rate risk
- Fully drawn credit facilities ($438M) most concerning aspect—indicates liquidity stress
- 38% mortgage maturities in 2025 create refinancing urgency

**Asset Coverage:**
- Investment properties of $2,026M provide 1.88x coverage of total debt ($1,080M)
- Including held-for-sale properties ($233M) and equity investments ($108M), coverage improves to 2.20x
- However, equity investments lack transparency and held-for-sale valuation unproven by market
- Conservative assumption: core investment properties provide adequate but not strong coverage

### Credit Loss Analysis

**Expected Credit Losses on Preferred Investments:**
- Q2 loss of $26M on unknown preferred investment portfolio
- YTD losses of $34.2M represent material equity impairment
- Limited disclosure on nature, size, or remaining exposure to these investments
- Losses suggest either:
  - Prior aggressive capital allocation to higher-risk investments
  - Deterioration in specific borrower(s) credit quality
  - Geographic or sector concentration risk
- **Credit Concern:** Lack of transparency about remaining exposure and potential for additional losses

### NAV Discount Implications

**Market Valuation:**
- 43% discount to $12.98 NAV implies market value ~$7.42/unit
- Total equity market value: ~$736M (99.2M units × $7.42)
- Book equity: $1,456M
- Implied market value of assets: ~$1,816M vs book $2,611M (30% discount)

**Interpretation:**
- Market questioning either:
  - IFRS fair values overstating true market values by ~30%
  - Execution risk that portfolio sales will require material discounts
  - Both asset value and execution risk
- Single Q2 asset sale at IFRS value ($4.8M) insufficient to validate broader portfolio values
- NAV discount represents significant credit risk indicator—if market proves correct, book equity is overstated and leverage worse than reported

### Liquidity Analysis Details

**Sources of Liquidity (next 12 months):**
- Quarterly AFFO: ~$8M × 4 = $32M annually
- Asset sales potential: $233M held for sale (assuming 80-100% of book = $186-233M)
- Equity investment liquidations: $108M potential (uncertain)
- **Total potential sources: $226-373M**

**Uses of Liquidity (next 12 months):**
- Distributions: ~$3M quarterly × 4 = $12M annually
- 2025 mortgage maturities: ~$244M (38% of $641M)
- Capital expenditures: ~$8M quarterly × 4 = $32M (implied from FFO-AFFO gap)
- **Total uses: ~$288M**

**Net Liquidity Position:**
- **Tight:** Requires substantial asset sales ($200M+) to meet obligations
- Credit facilities already fully drawn provide no cushion
- Successful execution of asset sales and refinancings is critical
- Any shortfall in disposition proceeds or refinancing difficulties creates acute stress

```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
