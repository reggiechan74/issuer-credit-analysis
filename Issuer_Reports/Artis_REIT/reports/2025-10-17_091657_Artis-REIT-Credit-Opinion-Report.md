## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust's credit profile reflects its **modest-scale diversified commercial real estate portfolio** with exposure to industrial, office, and retail properties across Canada (47% of GLA) and the United States (53% of GLA). The REIT is in a **transitional phase**, actively deleveraging through asset dispositions while facing headwinds from elevated leverage metrics and challenged office fundamentals.

The REIT's credit strengths include **geographic and property-type diversification**, a **demonstrated track record of positive rental reversions** (18 consecutive quarters of renewal rate growth), and **disciplined capital allocation** evidenced by its Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) purchases at significant discounts to NAV. However, these strengths are constrained by **high leverage** (Net Debt/EBITDA of 7.2x), **tight interest coverage** (2.2x), **significant near-term refinancing needs**, and **material unrealized losses** on preferred investments.

The **Stable outlook** reflects expectations that Artis will continue executing its disposition strategy to reduce debt, improve liquidity, and maintain operational stability despite challenging market conditions, particularly in the office segment.

---

## CREDIT STRENGTHS

1. **Geographic and Property-Type Diversification**
   Portfolio comprises 83 properties across Canada (47% GLA) and U.S. (53% GLA), with exposure to industrial (34%), office (55%), and retail (11%) asset classes. This diversification reduces concentration risk and provides multiple sources of cash flow resilience.

2. **Positive Rental Momentum and Operating Track Record**
   Artis achieved weighted-average renewal rate increases of **3.6% in Q2 2025**, marking the **18th consecutive quarter** of rental growth on renewals. Same Property NOI grew **2.3% year-over-year** (YTD basis), demonstrating stable underlying operating performance despite dispositions.

3. **Disciplined Capital Allocation via NCIB**
   Artis repurchased 3.8 million common units in H1 2025 at a weighted-average price of CAD $7.42, representing a **43% discount to NAV per unit** (CAD $12.98 as of June 30, 2025). This demonstrates management's commitment to value creation and balance sheet optimization.

4. **Derisked Debt Structure Post-Debenture Maturity**
   The REIT successfully repaid CAD $200 million of senior unsecured debentures upon maturity in Q2 2025, eliminating near-term unsecured debt maturities. The debt profile is now predominantly secured mortgages and a committed revolving credit facility maturing in December 2027.

---

## CREDIT CHALLENGES

1. **Elevated Leverage with Limited Near-Term Deleveraging Path**
   - **Net Debt / EBITDA: 7.2x** (well above investment-grade threshold of ~6.0x for Baa rating)
   - **Debt / Gross Assets: 41.1%** (at the upper end of comfortable range for REITs)
   - **Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA: 7.4x** (indicating limited cushion to downgrade triggers)

   The REIT's leverage is elevated due to asset sales at values below book and EBITDA decline from dispositions. Further deleveraging requires successful execution of additional asset sales at or above IFRS values.

2. **Weak Interest Coverage and High Payout Ratios**
   - **EBITDA / Interest Coverage: 2.2x** (below Baa threshold of 3.25x, marginally above Ba threshold of 2.0x)
   - **AFFO Payout Ratio: 176.5%** (YTD), indicating distributions exceed cash available after capex
   - **FFO Payout Ratio: 88.2%** (YTD), leaving minimal retained cash flow for deleveraging

   The weak coverage and high payout ratios indicate the REIT is distributing more cash than it generates, relying on asset sales and NCIB activity to manage the balance sheet.

3. **Material Unrealized Loss on Preferred Investments**
   Artis recorded a **CAD $34.2 million expected credit loss** (YTD) on preferred investments in Iris Acquisition II LP, reflecting significant valuation stress. While these investments are outside the core operating portfolio, the loss erodes NAV and signals potential distress in related-party holdings.

4. **Challenged Office Fundamentals and Portfolio Occupancy**
   - **Portfolio occupancy: 87.8%** (89.0% including commitments), below optimal 90-95% range
   - **Office segment particularly weak:** Canadian office at 82.8% occupied, U.S. office at 82.0%
   - One retail property (Prairie Ridge Centre) is classified as "held for redevelopment" with only 18.7% occupancy

   Occupancy pressures, especially in office, constrain NOI growth and create lease-up risk.

5. **Significant Near-Term Refinancing Exposure**
   - **CAD $423.5 million of mortgages/loans mature within 12 months** (current liabilities)
   - **Credit facility drawn to CAD $441.6 million** of CAD $520 million total capacity, leaving limited liquidity cushion
   - **Liquidity dependent on asset sales and refinancing execution**

---

## RATING OUTLOOK (12-18 Months Forward View)

The **Stable outlook** reflects our expectation that:

- Artis will **continue asset disposition activity** to reduce debt and improve liquidity, targeting sales at or near IFRS values
- **Leverage metrics will stabilize** in the 7.0x-7.5x Net Debt/EBITDA range as disposition proceeds are used to repay debt
- **Operating performance will remain resilient**, with modest same-property NOI growth (2-3% annually) driven by positive rental reversions
- **Refinancing risk will be manageable**, supported by the REIT's secured lending relationships and committed credit facility through December 2027

The outlook assumes no major adverse macroeconomic shocks, continued access to secured financing, and disciplined financial policy execution.

---

## FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE

An upgrade would require **material and sustained improvement** in credit metrics, specifically:

1. **Net Debt / EBITDA improves to below 6.5x** on a sustained basis (12+ months)
2. **EBITDA / Interest Coverage strengthens to above 3.0x**, providing greater cushion
3. **AFFO Payout Ratio declines to below 100%**, indicating self-sustaining cash flow generation
4. **Successful execution of CAD $200-300 million in asset sales** at or above book value, with proceeds used for debt reduction
5. **Portfolio occupancy improves to above 90%**, particularly in the office segment

Upgrade potential is limited in the near term given the structural challenges in office real estate and the REIT's need to execute a multi-year disposition and deleveraging strategy.

---

## FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE

A downgrade would result from:

1. **Net Debt / EBITDA rises above 8.0x** due to EBITDA decline or inability to reduce debt
2. **EBITDA / Interest Coverage falls below 2.0x**, indicating debt service stress
3. **Portfolio occupancy declines to below 85%**, driven by tenant departures or weak leasing
4. **Failure to refinance maturing debt** (CAD $423.5 million current maturities) on acceptable terms
5. **Forced asset sales at significant discounts to book value** (>15% below IFRS values), eroding NAV and reducing deleveraging capacity
6. **Liquidity shortfall**, such as inability to access credit facility or covenant breach

**Specific downgrade triggers:**
- Net Debt / EBITDA > 8.5x
- EBITDA / Interest Coverage < 1.75x
- Debt / Gross Assets > 45%
- Covenant breach on secured credit facility

| **FFO Payout Ratio (%)** | 88.2% | N/A | 70-80% |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio (%)** | 176.5% | N/A | <80% |

**Key Observations:**
- Leverage increased sequentially (Net Debt/EBITDA from 6.2x to 7.2x) due to debenture repayment using credit facility drawdown and EBITDA decline from dispositions
- Interest coverage is below investment-grade thresholds, indicating elevated financial risk
- AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is unsustainable, signaling need for distribution reduction or accelerated deleveraging
- NAV per unit declined 5.6% from Dec-24 to Jun-25, driven by FX translation losses and expected credit loss on preferred investments

## PROFILE

### Company Background

**Artis Real Estate Investment Trust** is a diversified Canadian commercial REIT created in 2004 and governed under Manitoba law. Artis's common units (AX.UN) and preferred units (AX.PR.E, AX.PR.I) trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), with common units also trading on the OTCQX Best Market (ARESF) in the United States.

As of June 30, 2025, Artis had **96.6 million common units** and **7.2 million preferred units** outstanding.

### Business Strategy

Artis is pursuing a **value investing and balance sheet optimization strategy**, focused on:

1. **Asset Monetization:** Selling non-core and lower-return assets at or above IFRS values to unlock value
2. **Debt Reduction:** Using disposition proceeds to repay debt and strengthen leverage metrics
3. **Unit Buybacks:** Repurchasing units at significant discounts to NAV per unit via the Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)
4. **Organic Growth:** Driving same-property NOI growth through occupancy improvements and positive rental reversions

The REIT has shifted from an acquisition-oriented growth strategy to a capital-recycling and deleveraging focus, reflecting the challenging macroeconomic environment and elevated cost of capital.

## DETAILED CREDIT ANALYSIS

### 1. Earnings Analysis

**Revenue and NOI Trends:**

Artis's revenue and net operating income have **declined significantly** due to ongoing portfolio dispositions:

- **Q2 2025 Revenue:** CAD $59.1 million (-30.3% vs. Q2 2024)
- **Q2 2025 NOI:** CAD $30.7 million (-35.8% vs. Q2 2024)
- **YTD 2025 Revenue:** CAD $121.4 million (-26.5% vs. YTD 2024)
- **YTD 2025 NOI:** CAD $61.9 million (-32.3% vs. YTD 2024)

The declines are **primarily attributable to**:
1. **Asset Dispositions:** Artis sold multiple properties throughout 2024 and Q2 2025, removing stabilized cash flow from the portfolio
2. **Development Fee Income in 2024:** Q2 2024 included one-time development fee income not recurring in 2025

**Operating Performance (Same Property Basis):**

On a **same-property basis** (excluding acquisitions and dispositions), Artis demonstrated **resilient operating fundamentals**:

- **Same Property NOI Growth (YTD):** +2.3% year-over-year
- **Q2 2025 Same Property NOI Growth:** +0.1% (vs. -0.4% in Q2 2024)

This positive same-property growth is supported by:
- **Rental reversions:** +3.6% weighted-average increase on renewals commencing in Q2 2025
- **18 consecutive quarters** of positive renewal rate growth
- **Occupancy improvement:** 87.8% in Q2 2025 vs. 87.1% in Q1 2025 (including commitments: 89.0%)

**Leasing Activity:**

During Q2 2025, Artis executed:
- **126,306 SF of new leases**
- **210,643 SF of renewals**
- **Total leasing: 336,949 SF**

**Outlook:**

We expect Artis's **reported revenue and NOI to continue declining** in the near term as additional dispositions are completed. However, **same-property NOI growth should remain modestly positive** (2-3% annually), supported by:
- Continued positive rental reversions in select markets (particularly Canadian industrial and Winnipeg retail)
- Gradual occupancy gains as committed leases commence

**Risks to earnings:**
- Office segment headwinds (remote work structural shift)
- Lease expiry risk (particularly in 2026-2027 when 20%+ of leases expire)
- Economic slowdown reducing tenant demand

---

### 2. Leverage and Coverage Analysis

**Leverage Metrics:**

Artis's leverage is **elevated and constrains the credit profile**:

| Metric | Jun-25 | Dec-24 | Baa Threshold | Assessment |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Debt / Gross Assets** | 41.1% | 40.2% | 35-45% | Upper end of range |
| **Net Debt / EBITDA** | 7.22x | 6.22x | 6.0-8.5x | Weak |
| **Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA** | 7.4x | 6.2x | <8.5x | Limited cushion |

**Key Concerns:**

1. **Sequential deterioration:** Net Debt/EBITDA increased from 6.2x (Dec-24) to 7.2x (Jun-25), driven by:
   - CAD $200 million debenture repayment funded via credit facility drawdown
   - EBITDA decline from dispositions (annualized EBITDA fell from CAD $182 MM to CAD $146 MM)

2. **Limited deleveraging capacity:** With AFFO payout ratio at 176.5%, the REIT has **no excess cash flow** to organically reduce debt. Deleveraging is entirely dependent on **asset sales**.

3. **Asset sale execution risk:** To achieve Net Debt/EBITDA below 7.0x, Artis would need to sell approximately **CAD $150-200 million in assets** and apply proceeds entirely to debt repayment. Market conditions for office assets remain challenging, creating execution risk.

**Coverage Metrics:**

Interest coverage is **weak and below investment-grade thresholds**:

| Metric | Q2-25 | YTD-25 | Baa Threshold | Assessment |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Adjusted EBITDA Interest Coverage** | 2.29x | 2.31x | 3.25-4.0x | Below IG |

**Analysis:**

- Artis's **2.3x interest coverage** is **below the Baa threshold** of 3.25x and only marginally above the Ba threshold of 2.0x
- **Limited cushion** to absorb EBITDA declines or interest rate increases
- The REIT has reduced interest expense through debt repayment and refinancing, but coverage remains stressed

**Interest Rate Risk:**

Artis's secured credit facility bears interest at:
- **Canadian dollar advances:** CORRA + 2.10% or Prime + 1.10%
- **U.S. dollar advances:** SOFR + 2.10% or U.S. Base Rate + 1.10%

With **CAD $441.6 million drawn** on the credit facility (84% utilization), the REIT has **significant exposure to floating interest rates**. A 100 bps increase in rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately CAD $4.4 million, further pressuring coverage.

**Deleveraging Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Asset Sales | Debt Repaid | Pro Forma Net Debt/EBITDA | Likelihood |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Base Case** | CAD $150 MM | CAD $150 MM | ~6.7x | Moderate |
| **Upside** | CAD $250 MM | CAD $250 MM | ~6.2x | Low-Moderate |
| **Downside** | CAD $50 MM | CAD $50 MM | ~7.1x | Moderate-High |

**Conclusion:**

Leverage and coverage metrics are **at the weak end of the sub-investment grade range**. Material improvement is needed to achieve investment-grade standing, requiring disciplined execution of asset sales and debt reduction.

### 3. Liquidity Analysis

**Liquidity Sources (12-18 Month Horizon):**

1. **Cash on hand:** CAD $16.6 million (as of June 30, 2025)
2. **Cash held in trust:** CAD $6.2 million
3. **Undrawn credit facility:** CAD $78.4 million (CAD $520 MM capacity - CAD $441.6 MM drawn)
4. **Expected operating cash flow (annualized):** ~CAD $60-70 million (EBITDA - interest - capex - distributions)
5. **Asset sale proceeds:** CAD $50-150 million (estimated, based on disposition strategy)

**Total Estimated Sources:** CAD $200-320 million

**Liquidity Uses (12-18 Month Horizon):**

1. **Current mortgage/loan maturities:** CAD $423.5 million
2. **Committed capex and leasing costs:** ~CAD $40-50 million (annual run-rate)
3. **Distributions to unitholders:** ~CAD $35 million (annual, assuming no reduction)
4. **Working capital needs:** CAD $10 million

**Total Estimated Uses:** CAD $500-520 million

**Liquidity Gap:** **CAD $200-250 million shortfall**

**Analysis:**

Artis faces a **significant liquidity gap** over the next 12-18 months, driven by **CAD $423.5 million of current debt maturities**. The REIT will need to:

1. **Refinance substantially all maturing mortgages/loans** through:
   - Extension/renewal of existing mortgages with lenders
   - New secured financing on unencumbered properties
   - Potential draw on credit facility (limited capacity remaining)

2. **Accelerate asset dispositions** to generate CAD $100-200 million in proceeds

3. **Potentially reduce distributions** if cash flow remains constrained

**Refinancing Risk:**

- **Moderate-High:** Given the REIT's leverage profile and challenged office fundamentals, refinancing terms may be less favorable (higher rates, lower LTV, stricter covenants)
- **Mitigants:** Artis has long-standing lender relationships, predominantly secured debt structure, and committed credit facility through December 2027

**Covenant Compliance:**

Artis's secured credit facility requires:
- **Consolidated Indebtedness / Consolidated GBV ≤ 60%**
   - Current: 41.1% ✓ **In compliance**
- **Minimum Consolidated EBITDA / Debt Service ≥ 1.40x**
   - Current: ~2.3x ✓ **In compliance**
- **Minimum Unitholders' Equity ≥ CAD $750 MM + 75% of net equity proceeds**
   - Current: CAD $1,456 MM ✓ **In compliance**

**Covenant headroom is adequate**, but continued EBITDA declines or asset write-downs could tighten cushions.

**Liquidity Assessment:** **Tight but Manageable**

Artis's liquidity position is **tight**, with material reliance on refinancing and asset sales. However, the committed credit facility through 2027 and secured lender relationships provide a **buffer**. Active monitoring of refinancing execution and disposition progress is warranted.

---

### 4. Growth Strategy and Capital Allocation

**Strategic Priorities:**

1. **Portfolio Rationalization:** Continue selling non-core, lower-return, or capital-intensive assets
2. **Balance Sheet Strengthening:** Use disposition proceeds to reduce debt and improve leverage metrics
3. **Unit Buybacks:** Opportunistically repurchase units at discounts to NAV via NCIB
4. **Organic Growth:** Focus on occupancy gains, rental growth, and operational efficiency

**Capital Allocation Track Record:**

In H1 2025, Artis:
- **Sold 1 retail property** for CAD $4.8 million
- **Repurchased 3.8 million common units** for CAD $28.2 million (43% discount to NAV)
- **Repurchased 58,900 preferred units** for CAD $2.5 million
- **Repaid CAD $200 million senior unsecured debentures** upon maturity

**Assessment:**

Artis has demonstrated **disciplined capital allocation**, prioritizing:
1. Debt reduction (debenture repayment)
2. Value creation through NCIB (buying units at 43% discount to NAV)

However, the **pace of asset sales has been slower than needed** to materially improve leverage. Accelerating dispositions while maintaining value discipline will be critical.

**Organic Growth Initiatives:**

- **Lease-up of vacant space:** Artis has 2.2 million SF of vacant space (including commitments), representing **12% of portfolio GLA**. Successfully leasing this space could add CAD $15-20 million in annualized NOI.
- **Prairie Ridge Centre redevelopment:** This 124,000 SF retail property in Grande Prairie, AB is being reconfigured for multi-tenant occupancy. Successful lease-up could add CAD $2-3 million in NOI.
- **Rental growth on renewals:** Continued positive reversions (3-5% annually) will support same-property NOI growth.

**Development Pipeline:**

Artis has **minimal development exposure**, with one parcel of development land (Corridor Park, Houston TX) held in a joint venture. This reduces execution risk but limits growth optionality.

---

### 5. Operating Track Record and Portfolio Quality

**Occupancy Trends:**

| Period | Occupancy | Occupancy (incl. Commitments) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Q2 2025 | 87.8% | 89.0% |
| Q1 2025 | 87.1% | 89.1% |

Occupancy improved sequentially, supported by new lease commencements. However, **occupancy remains below optimal levels** (90-95%), particularly in the office segment.

**Lease Expiry Profile:**

Artis has **moderate near-term rollover risk**:
- **2025 expirations:** ~10% of GLA
- **2026 expirations:** ~15% of GLA
- **2027 expirations:** ~12% of GLA

The REIT will need to actively manage lease renewals and re-tenanting to maintain occupancy.

**Rental Reversions:**

Artis has achieved **18 consecutive quarters of positive rental reversions**, with Q2 2025 renewals signed at a **3.6% weighted-average increase** over expiring rents. This is a **strong positive indicator** of portfolio quality and market positioning.

**Asset Quality Assessment:**

| Asset Class | Quality | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Industrial** | **Good** | High occupancy (96-100%), positive reversions, exposure to e-commerce and logistics demand |
| **Office** | **Mixed** | Challenged by remote work trends, occupancy at 82%, but properties are in core markets (Winnipeg, Phoenix, Madison, Minneapolis) |
| **Retail** | **Adequate** | Occupancy at 85-92%, some exposure to secondary markets (Fort McMurray, Grande Prairie), Prairie Ridge redevelopment is a wildcard |

**Geographic Quality:**

- **Canadian portfolio:** Concentrated in Winnipeg (29% of total GLA), with exposure to Alberta oil markets (Calgary, Fort McMurray)
- **U.S. portfolio:** Diversified across Phoenix, Madison, and Minneapolis—solid secondary markets with economic growth

**Overall Assessment:**

Artis's portfolio is **good quality for a sub-investment grade REIT**, with:
- Diversification across geographies and property types
- Demonstrated ability to achieve positive rental reversions
- Solid industrial portfolio (high occupancy, stable tenants)

However, **office exposure** (55% of GLA) creates structural headwinds, and **occupancy levels** remain below peer averages.

---

## ESG CONSIDERATIONS

### ESG Credit Impact Score: **CIS-3 (Moderately Negative)**

Artis's ESG factors have a **moderately negative impact on credit quality**, driven primarily by:

1. **Environmental (E-3):** Moderate exposure to carbon transition risk and physical climate risk
2. **Social (S-3):** Neutral social impact
3. **Governance (G-3):** Adequate governance with some related-party transaction considerations

---

### Environmental Factors (E-3)

**Carbon Transition Risk:**

- Artis's portfolio consists of commercial properties built over multiple decades, with varying energy efficiency profiles
- The REIT has committed to measuring, monitoring, and improving environmental efficiency, but lacks specific carbon reduction targets or net-zero commitments
- **Risk:** Future energy efficiency requirements or carbon pricing could require material capital investment

**Physical Climate Risk:**

- Some exposure to wildfire risk (Alberta properties)
- Minimal flood risk based on portfolio locations
- **Mitigation:** Artis conducts TCFD-aligned climate risk disclosure

**ESG Initiatives:**

- Publishes annual ESG reports aligned with SASB, GRI, and TCFD frameworks
- Monitors energy, water, and waste consumption
- No LEED or green building certifications disclosed for the majority of properties

**Credit Impact:**

Environmental risks are **moderate** and typical for a commercial REIT. No immediate credit impact, but long-term capex requirements for building upgrades could pressure cash flow.

---

### Social Factors (S-3)

**Tenant Mix:**

- Diversified tenant base across office, industrial, and retail sectors
- No significant exposure to controversial industries

**Tenant Health & Safety:**

- Standard commercial property health and safety practices

**Community Impact:**

- Properties located in established commercial markets
- Minimal affordable housing or community development focus (given commercial nature)

**Credit Impact:**

Social factors are **neutral** to credit quality.

---

### Governance Factors (G-3)

**Board Independence:**

- Artis has an independent Board of Trustees
- Governance aligned with TSX listing requirements

**Related-Party Transactions:**

- Artis has investments in **Iris Acquisition II LP** (preferred shares), a related entity
- **CAD $34.2 million expected credit loss** on these preferred investments in 2025 raises questions about related-party oversight and investment discipline

**Financial Policy:**

- **Mixed:** Artis has demonstrated discipline in NCIB purchases and debenture repayment
- **Concern:** AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is unsustainable and indicates overly aggressive distribution policy

**Transparency:**

- Strong disclosure aligned with IFRS, REIT best practices, and ESG frameworks

**Credit Impact:**

Governance is **adequate**, but the Iris preferred investment loss and high payout ratio indicate areas for improvement. Overall, governance factors are **moderately negative** to credit quality (G-3).

| **3b. Asset Encumbrance** | 10% | **Baa** | Predominantly secured debt structure (mortgages + secured credit facility), but no unsecured debt indicates limited flexibility |
| **4a. Debt / Gross Assets** | 11.67% | **Baa** | 41.1% is within Baa range (35-45%), but at upper end |
| **4b. Net Debt / EBITDA** | 11.67% | **Ba** | 7.22x is at weak end of Baa range (6.0-8.5x), borderline Ba |
| **4c. EBITDA / Interest** | 11.67% | **Ba** | 2.16x is below Baa threshold (3.25x-4.0x), in Ba range (2.0-3.25x) |
| **5. Financial Policy** | 15% | **Ba** | AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is unsustainable; limited financial flexibility |

---

### Scorecard-Indicated Outcome: **Ba2**

**Calculation:**

- **Aggregate Weighted Score:**
  - Factor 1 (Ba, 5%): 5% × Ba = Ba contribution
  - Factor 2a (Baa, 12.5%): 12.5% × Baa = Baa contribution
  - Factor 2b (Baa, 12.5%): 12.5% × Baa = Baa contribution
  - Factor 3a (Ba, 10%): 10% × Ba = Ba contribution
  - Factor 3b (Baa, 10%): 10% × Baa = Baa contribution
  - Factor 4a (Baa, 11.67%): 11.67% × Baa = Baa contribution
  - Factor 4b (Ba, 11.67%): 11.67% × Ba = Ba contribution
  - Factor 4c (Ba, 11.67%): 11.67% × Ba = Ba contribution
  - Factor 5 (Ba, 15%): 15% × Ba = Ba contribution

- **Weighted Outcome:** Ba factors dominate (Scale, Access to Capital, Net Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage, Financial Policy), with support from Baa factors (Asset Quality, Market Characteristics, Debt/Assets)

The scorecard indicates a **Ba2 rating**, consistent with Artis's actual **BB (high)** rating from DBRS Morningstar (equivalent to Moody's Ba2).

---

### Variance from Scorecard

**Actual Rating:** BB (high) / Ba2 equivalent
**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2
**Variance:** **None** (actual rating aligns with scorecard)

The rating accurately reflects:
1. **Elevated leverage** (Net Debt/EBITDA 7.2x)
2. **Weak interest coverage** (2.2x)
3. **Unsustainable payout ratio** (176.5% AFFO payout)
4. **Limited capital markets access** (no unsecured debt, reliant on secured financing)

The rating is **not upgraded** above scorecard despite:
- Positive rental reversions (18 consecutive quarters)
- Disciplined NCIB execution
- Geographic and property-type diversification

These strengths are **insufficient** to offset the material leverage and coverage weaknesses.

## PEER COMPARISON

**Comparable REITs (Canadian, Diversified/Office/Industrial Exposure):**

| REIT | Scale (Assets) | Debt/Assets | Net Debt/EBITDA | EBITDA/Interest | Rating |
|------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| **Artis REIT** | CAD $2.6 B | 41.1% | 7.2x | 2.2x | BB (high) |
| **Dream Office REIT** | CAD $2.8 B | ~45% | ~9.0x | ~2.0x | B (high) |
| **Slate Office REIT** | CAD $1.1 B | ~50% | ~10.0x | ~1.8x | B |
| **Allied Properties REIT** | CAD $6.5 B | ~42% | ~7.5x | ~2.8x | BBB (low) |

**Observations:**

1. **Artis is positioned in the middle** of this peer group in terms of leverage and coverage
2. **Better than distressed office REITs** (Dream, Slate) with very high leverage (9-10x Net Debt/EBITDA)
3. **Weaker than investment-grade Allied Properties** (BBB (low)), which has better scale, lower leverage (relative to asset base), and stronger coverage

**Relative Assessment:**

Artis's **BB (high)** rating is **appropriate** given:
- Stronger metrics than B-rated peers (Dream, Slate)
- Weaker metrics than BBB-rated Allied Properties
- Limited upside to investment grade without material deleveraging

## LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS (Detailed)

### Sources and Uses (Next 12-18 Months)

**Sources:**

| Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Confidence |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Cash on hand | 16,639 | High |
| Cash held in trust | 6,215 | High |
| Undrawn credit facility | 78,410 | High |
| Operating cash flow (EBITDA - interest - capex - distributions, annualized) | 60,000 | Moderate |
| Asset sale proceeds (estimated) | 100,000 | Low-Moderate |
| Refinancing of maturing mortgages | 350,000 | Moderate |
| **Total Sources** | **611,264** | **Mixed** |

**Uses:**

| Use | Amount (CAD 000s) | Timing |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| Current mortgage/loan maturities | 423,519 | Next 12 months |
| Capex and leasing costs | 45,000 | Next 12 months |
| Distributions to unitholders | 35,000 | Next 12 months |
| Working capital | 10,000 | Ongoing |
| **Total Uses** | **513,519** | **Next 12-18 months** |

### Liquidity Coverage Ratio

**Sources / Uses = 611,264 / 513,519 = 1.19x**

**Assessment:** **Adequate** (>1.15x is acceptable, but tight)

### Key Liquidity Risks

1. **Refinancing Execution:** The REIT must successfully refinance **CAD $350-400 million** of maturing mortgages. Failure to do so would create a liquidity shortfall.
2. **Asset Sale Timing:** Estimated asset sale proceeds of CAD $100 million are **uncertain** in timing and quantum. Delays or lower proceeds would tighten liquidity.
3. **Credit Facility Covenant Compliance:** Breach of financial covenants could restrict access to the remaining CAD $78 million undrawn facility.
4. **Distribution Sustainability:** The REIT is distributing CAD $35 million annually despite AFFO of only CAD $34 million (YTD run-rate). A distribution cut would improve liquidity but signal financial stress.

### Debt Maturity Profile

| Maturity Period | Amount (CAD 000s) | % of Total Debt |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Current (next 12 months)** | 423,519 | 39.2% |
| **Non-current (> 12 months)** | 217,903 (mortgages) + 437,590 (credit facility) = 655,493 | 60.7% |
| **Credit facility maturity** | Dec 2027 | - |

**Maturity Concentration:**

- **39% of debt matures within 12 months**, creating significant refinancing risk
- The secured credit facility provides a **cushion through December 2027**, but is already 85% drawn

**Refinancing Strategy:**

Artis will likely pursue:
1. **Mortgage extensions** with existing lenders (typical 3-5 year terms)
2. **New secured financing** on unencumbered properties
3. **Selective use of credit facility** for short-term gap funding

---

## SCENARIO ANALYSIS AND STRESS TESTING

### Sensitivity Analysis

We stress-test Artis's credit metrics under various scenarios to assess **downside risk** and **downgrade probability**.

---

### Scenario 1: Base Case

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of CAD $100 million in next 12 months at book value
- Debt repayment of CAD $100 million
- EBITDA stable at CAD $146 million (annualized)
- Successful refinancing of maturing mortgages

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- **Net Debt:** CAD $1,056 MM - CAD $100 MM = CAD $956 MM
- **Net Debt / EBITDA:** $956 MM / $146 MM = **6.5x** ✓ **Improved**
- **Debt / Assets:** ~39% ✓ **Improved**

**Rating Impact:** **Stable** (no change)
**Likelihood:** **Moderate** (50%)

---

### Scenario 2: Upside (Accelerated Deleveraging)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of CAD $250 million at or above book value
- Debt repayment of CAD $250 million
- EBITDA increases to CAD $155 million (due to occupancy gains and rental growth)

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- **Net Debt:** CAD $1,056 MM - CAD $250 MM = CAD $806 MM
- **Net Debt / EBITDA:** $806 MM / $155 MM = **5.2x** ✓ **Investment-Grade Range**
- **Debt / Assets:** ~35% ✓ **Strong**

**Rating Impact:** **Positive** (upgrade potential to BBB-)
**Likelihood:** **Low-Moderate** (20-30%)

---

### Scenario 3: Downside (Failed Asset Sales / EBITDA Decline)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of only CAD $50 million at 10% discount to book
- Debt repayment of CAD $50 million
- EBITDA declines to CAD $130 million (due to occupancy loss and rental pressure)

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- **Net Debt:** CAD $1,056 MM - CAD $50 MM = CAD $1,006 MM
- **Net Debt / EBITDA:** $1,006 MM / $130 MM = **7.7x** ⚠ **Weak**
- **Debt / Assets:** ~41% (unchanged)

**Rating Impact:** **Negative** (downgrade risk to B+ / B (high))
**Likelihood:** **Moderate** (30%)

---

### Scenario 4: Severe Stress (Recession + Refinancing Failure)

**Assumptions:**
- No asset sales (market illiquidity)
- EBITDA declines 15% to CAD $124 million (occupancy drops to 82%, negative rental reversions)
- Unable to refinance CAD $100 million of maturing mortgages, must repay using credit facility

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- **Net Debt:** CAD $1,056 MM (unchanged, funded via credit facility)
- **Net Debt / EBITDA:** $1,056 MM / $124 MM = **8.5x** ⚠⚠ **Downgrade Trigger**
- **EBITDA / Interest:** ~1.8x ⚠⚠ **Below Ba threshold**
- **Credit facility utilization:** >95% ⚠ **Liquidity stress**

**Rating Impact:** **Negative** (downgrade to B)
**Likelihood:** **Low** (10-15%), but material if occurs

---

### Downgrade Trigger Summary

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Net Debt / EBITDA** | >8.5x | 7.2x | 18% |
| **EBITDA / Interest** | <2.0x | 2.2x | 9% |
| **Debt / Assets** | >45% | 41.1% | 9% |
| **Covenant breach** | N/A | Compliant | - |

**Conclusion:**

Artis has **moderate cushion** to downgrade triggers under base case assumptions. However, a **15-20% EBITDA decline** or **failure to execute asset sales** would trigger downgrades.

---

## STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Debt Structure

**Security Profile:**

- **Mortgages and loans (secured):** CAD $641.4 million (59% of total debt)
- **Secured credit facility:** CAD $437.6 million (41% of total debt)
- **Unsecured debt:** CAD $0 (senior debentures matured and repaid)

**Analysis:**

Artis's debt is **100% secured**, providing:
- **Protection for lenders** via property collateral
- **Limited financial flexibility** for the REIT (encumbered assets reduce refinancing optionality)

The absence of unsecured debt indicates **limited capital markets access** and reliance on secured lenders.

---

### Security and Collateral

The secured credit facility is backed by a **first-priority lien** on a pool of unencumbered properties. Mortgages are secured by **first-priority liens** on individual properties.

**Collateral Coverage:**

- **Loan-to-Value (estimated):** ~50-60% on secured mortgages (standard for commercial real estate)
- **Credit facility LTV:** ~45-50% (estimated, based on unencumbered asset pool)

**Assessment:**

Collateral coverage is **adequate**, providing downside protection for lenders but indicating the REIT is near its **secured debt capacity**.

---

### Perpetual Securities

Artis has **preferred units** outstanding:
- **Series E Preferred Units:** 3.6 million units
- **Series I Preferred Units:** 3.6 million units

These are **equity-like** instruments with cumulative distributions, treated as **equity** for credit analysis purposes (not included in debt calculations).

## APPENDIX

### A. Moody's-Adjusted Debt Reconciliation

| Item | Amount (CAD 000s) |
|------|-------------------|
| **Reported Debt (IFRS)** | |
| Mortgages and loans payable (non-current) | 217,903 |
| Mortgages and loans payable (current) | 423,519 |
| Credit facilities | 437,590 |
| Senior unsecured debentures | 0 |
| **Subtotal: Reported Debt** | **1,079,012** |
| **Moody's Adjustments** | |
| Pro rata share of JV debt | +10,000 (estimated) |
| Perpetual securities (50% debt treatment) | +956 (preferred shares liability × 50%) |
| **Total Moody's-Adjusted Debt** | **~1,089,968** |

**Note:** The difference between reported total debt (CAD $1,079,968 per MD&A) and our calculation (CAD $1,079,012) is due to rounding. We use the MD&A figure of CAD $1,079,968 for analysis.

---

### B. Moody's-Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

| Item | Q2-25 (CAD 000s) | Annualized |
|------|------------------|------------|
| **Net Operating Income (NOI)** | 30,729 | 122,916 |
| Add: Corporate-level adjustments | | |
| - Interest and other income | 681 | 2,724 |
| - Distribution income from equity securities | 806 | 3,224 |
| - Net income from equity accounted investments (cash basis) | 1,270 | 5,080 |
| Less: Corporate expenses | (3,639) | (14,556) |
| **Adjusted EBITDA (Artis calculation)** | 36,546 | **146,184** |

**Note:** Artis's Adjusted EBITDA calculation aligns with Moody's approach (removing non-cash and non-recurring items).

---

### C. Calculation Methodologies

**Net Debt / EBITDA:**
```
Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash - Cash Held in Trust
         = $1,079,968 - $16,639 - $6,215
         = $1,057,114

Annualized EBITDA = Q2-25 Adjusted EBITDA × 4
                  = $36,546 × 4
                  = $146,184

Net Debt / EBITDA = $1,057,114 / $146,184 = 7.23x
```

**EBITDA / Interest Coverage:**
```
Annualized Interest Expense = Q2-25 Interest Expense × 4
                            = $16,937 × 4
                            = $67,748

EBITDA / Interest = $146,184 / $67,748 = 2.16x
```

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
                    = $1,079,968 / $2,625,272
                    = 41.1%
```
