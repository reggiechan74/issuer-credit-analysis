# Credit Opinion: Artis Real Estate Investment Trust

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Reporting Period:** Unknown
**Currency:** CAD

---

## Executive Summary

Artis REIT's credit profile reflects a **Ba/BB credit quality** (high speculative grade), consistent with its DBRS BB (high) rating with stable trend. The trust demonstrates solid asset management capabilities with a diversified 9.7 million square foot portfolio across Canada (48%) and the US (52%), generating stable cash flows from industrial (34.4%), office (54.7%), and retail (10.9%) properties. However, the credit profile is constrained by **elevated leverage** (Debt/Assets 41.3%), **weak interest coverage** (NOI/Interest 1.8x, EBITDA/Interest 2.31x), and an **unsustainable distribution policy** (AFFO payout ratio 176.5%). Positively, management has demonstrated financial discipline through strategic asset sales ($51.7M in H1 2025), the $200M debenture repayment, and accretive unit buybacks (NCIB purchases at $7.42 vs. NAV of $12.98). The credit outlook is **stable** for the next 12-18 months, predicated on continued deleveraging through asset sales, maintaining portfolio occupancy above 87%, and prudent capital allocation.

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2/BB
**Key Rating Drivers:** Leverage position, interest coverage, distribution sustainability, deleveraging trajectory
**Primary Risk:** Refinancing risk from fully drawn revolving credit facility and limited covenant headroom

## Credit Strengths

### 3.1 **Solid Asset Management Execution with Positive Momentum**
Artis demonstrates effective portfolio management, delivering 2.3% same-property NOI growth over the 6-month period ending June 30, 2025. The weighted-average renewal increase of 3.6% in Q2 2025 indicates positive rental reversions and favorable negotiations with tenants. Portfolio occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% including commitments) reflects stable operations, though below best-in-class levels.

### 3.2 **Geographic Diversification Reduces Single-Market Risk**
The portfolio's 48% Canada / 52% US split (by GLA) provides meaningful geographic diversification and mitigates country-specific regulatory or economic risks. This binational footprint offers optionality for capital allocation and reduces correlation to any single real estate market cycle.

### 3.3 **Demonstrated Financial Discipline and Deleveraging Progress**
Management's recent actions signal improved financial stewardship:
- **Asset recycling:** Sold 5 properties for $51.7M proceeds in H1 2025, targeting non-core or lower-yielding assets
- **Debt reduction:** Repaid $200M senior unsecured debentures in Q2 2025, reducing fixed charges
- **Accretive capital allocation:** NCIB purchases of 3.8M units at $7.42 average price vs. NAV of $12.98 represents 43% discount to intrinsic value, creating meaningful value per remaining unit

### 3.4 **Meaningful Scale with $2.6B Asset Base**
Total assets of $2.6B and investment properties of $2.0B provide sufficient scale to:
- Access institutional capital markets
- Spread corporate overhead across a large asset base
- Negotiate favorable financing terms
- Attract quality tenants

### 3.5 **Positive Rental Momentum in Challenging Office Market**
Despite structural headwinds facing office (54.7% of GLA), Artis achieved 3.6% weighted-average renewal increases in Q2 2025, indicating tenant retention and pricing power in select submarkets. This suggests quality of specific assets within the office portfolio.

### 3.6 **Strategic Vision Aligned with Creditor Interests**
Management's stated vision emphasizes "best-in-class real estate asset management platform focused on value investing" and strategy prioritizes "strengthen balance sheet" alongside "drive organic growth." This alignment with credit quality improvement is positive for bondholder protection.

## Credit Challenges

### 4.1 **Elevated Leverage with Limited Deleveraging Runway**
Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3% and Net Debt ratio of 40.7% position Artis at the aggressive end of the Ba rating spectrum. With modest same-property NOI growth (~2.3% run-rate) and significant interest expense ($68.7M annualized), organic deleveraging will be slow absent accelerated asset sales. At current trajectory, meaningful leverage improvement (targeting <38% for Baa threshold) would require 3-4 years or substantial equity issuance.

### 4.2 **Weak Interest Coverage Leaves Minimal Cushion**
NOI/Interest coverage of 1.8x and EBITDA/Interest coverage of 2.31x provide limited margin for error. Both metrics sit at the lower end of Ba range:
- **Ba benchmark:** 2.0-3.25x EBITDA/Interest
- **Artis position:** 2.31x (only 8 bps above minimum threshold)
- **Risk:** Any portfolio occupancy decline (100 bps = ~$1M NOI = -0.015x coverage) or interest rate increase would quickly pressure coverage below 2.0x, triggering potential covenant concerns or downgrade risk

### 4.3 **Unsustainable Distribution Policy**
The AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is fundamentally unsustainable and requires immediate attention:
- **AFFO per unit:** $0.34
- **Distributions per unit:** $0.60
- **Shortfall:** $0.26 per unit (76.5% deficit)
- **Implication:** Distributions currently funded by asset sales, debt proceeds, or balance sheet erosion rather than operating cash flow

While the FFO payout ratio of 88.2% appears marginally sustainable, AFFO is the superior metric as it accounts for maintenance capital expenditures. A distribution cut to $0.30-0.35 per unit would improve AFFO coverage to ~88-103%, which would be prudent from a credit perspective.

### 4.4 **Significant Refinancing Risk from Fully Drawn Revolver**
**Critical liquidity concern:** The revolving credit facility is fully drawn at $437.6M, representing:
- 40.6% of total debt ($1,079M)
- 16.8% of gross assets
- Cash of only $16.6M provides minimal buffer

This creates meaningful refinancing risk:
- **Maturity risk:** Facility maturity date not disclosed but typical revolvers are 3-5 year terms
- **Covenant risk:** No disclosed headroom on financial maintenance covenants
- **Market access risk:** Refinancing depends on maintaining credit metrics and capital market conditions
- **Flexibility constraint:** No undrawn capacity for acquisitions, development, or working capital needs

### 4.5 **Elevated Office Exposure During Structural Transition**
Office properties comprise 54.7% of total GLA, exposing Artis to secular headwinds:
- Post-pandemic office utilization pressures
- Remote/hybrid work reducing space needs per employee
- Tenant flight to quality (potential negative reversion for secondary assets)
- Rising capital expenditure requirements for ESG/amenity upgrades

While Artis has achieved positive rental reversions (+3.6% Q2 2025), the magnitude of renewal risk over next 3-5 years creates material downside scenario potential.

### 4.6 **Limited Financial Flexibility for Growth**
The combination of elevated leverage (41.3%), fully drawn revolver, and high distribution burden constrains strategic optionality:
- Minimal capacity for acquisitions without equity issuance
- Limited ability to fund value-add capex or developments
- Constrained response to unexpected tenant departures or property-specific issues
- Forced seller status if liquidity deteriorates

## Rating Outlook

### 5.1 **Short-Term Outlook (6-12 Months): STABLE**

The credit rating is expected to remain **stable** over the next 6-12 months, predicated on:

**Base Case Assumptions:**
- Portfolio occupancy maintained at 87-89% range
- Continued same-property NOI growth of 2.0-2.5%
- Execution of $50-100M additional asset sales in H2 2025 - H1 2026
- Interest rates stabilize (no further material increase in cost of debt)
- Successful refinancing/extension of any maturing facilities

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Debt/Assets gradually declines to 39-40% by mid-2026 (from asset sale proceeds applied to debt)
- Interest coverage remains in 2.2-2.5x range (EBITDA/Interest basis)
- Distribution policy maintained (though unsustainable, near-term cash flow adequate)
- Liquidity supplemented by asset sales

**Key Monitoring Points:**
- Quarterly occupancy trends (trigger for concern if falls below 85%)
- Pace and pricing of asset dispositions
- Distribution policy announcements
- Covenant compliance disclosures
- Revolver maturity date and refinancing intentions

### 5.2 **Medium-Term Outlook (1-3 Years): POSITIVE-TO-STABLE**

Over a 1-3 year horizon, the outlook becomes **cautiously constructive** if management executes on deleveraging strategy:

**Positive Scenario (40% probability):**
- Debt/Assets declines to 36-38% through disciplined asset sales ($200-300M aggregate over 2-3 years)
- Distribution policy rationalized to 80-90% AFFO payout (~$0.30-0.35/unit), improving financial flexibility
- Interest coverage improves to 2.5-2.8x as NOI grows and debt declines
- Portfolio rebalanced toward industrial/flex (reducing office to <50% of GLA)
- **Outcome:** Potential upgrade to Baa3/BBB- (investment grade threshold)

**Base Case Scenario (50% probability):**
- Debt/Assets stabilizes around 38-40%
- Distribution policy unchanged, continuing to constrain financial flexibility
- Interest coverage remains 2.2-2.5x
- Portfolio composition relatively stable with modest office reduction
- **Outcome:** Rating remains Ba2/BB (high), stable outlook

**Negative Scenario (10% probability):**
- Portfolio occupancy deteriorates to <85% due to office tenant losses
- Asset sale execution slows or realized pricing disappoints (below book value)
- Distribution maintained despite worsening coverage, depleting liquidity
- Revolver refinancing challenges emerge
- **Outcome:** Downgrade to Ba3/BB- or Ba3/BB (negative outlook)

### 5.3 **Key Rating Drivers Over Next 12-24 Months**

**Positive Drivers (Upgrade Potential):**
1. **Leverage improvement:** Debt/Assets declines below 38%
2. **Coverage strengthening:** EBITDA/Interest reaches 2.75x+
3. **Distribution rationalization:** AFFO payout ratio reduced to <100%
4. **Liquidity enhancement:** Revolving facility extended with meaningful undrawn capacity
5. **Portfolio repositioning:** Office reduced to <50% GLA through strategic sales/acquisitions

**Negative Drivers (Downgrade Risk):**
1. **Coverage deterioration:** EBITDA/Interest falls below 2.0x
2. **Occupancy decline:** Portfolio occupancy drops below 85%
3. **Liquidity stress:** Inability to refinance revolver or fund maturing debt
4. **Asset impairments:** Write-downs indicating overstated book values
5. **Distribution maintenance:** Continued 176% AFFO payout depleting financial flexibility

6. **Covenant Headroom:**
   - Financial maintenance covenants maintain >15% headroom
   - No covenant waivers or amendments required

**Probability Assessment:**
- **24-month upgrade probability:** 30-35%
- **Primary dependencies:** Distribution cut, accelerated deleveraging, occupancy maintenance
- **Key enabler:** Distribution cut to sustainable levels is likely prerequisite for investment-grade rating

### 7.2 **Downgrade Factors**

Artis REIT could be downgraded to **Ba3/BB-** or lower if the following negative developments occur:

**Quantitative Triggers:**

1. **Coverage Deterioration:**
   - EBITDA/Interest coverage falls **<2.0x** (from current 2.31x)
   - Could result from:
     - Portfolio occupancy declining to <85% (300 bps decline = ~$4M NOI loss)
     - Interest rate spike on floating-rate debt (200 bps × $200M floating = $4M annual increase)
     - Asset impairments reducing EBITDA

2. **Leverage Increase:**
   - Debt/Gross Assets increases **>43%** (from current 41.3%)
   - Could result from:
     - Asset write-downs (10% portfolio value decline = ~43-44% leverage)

   - Require equity issuance at material discount to NAV to avoid default
   - Covenant breach leading to accelerated maturity

6. **Strategic Missteps:**
   - Distribution maintained at 176% AFFO payout despite worsening credit metrics
   - Debt-funded acquisitions that don't meet hurdle rates
   - Related-party transactions that disadvantage public unitholders/creditors

**Stress Scenario Analysis:**

**Severe Downside Case:**
- Office portfolio occupancy declines 500 bps to 82.8% overall
- Same-property NOI contracts -3% due to negative rental reversions
- Asset values decline 10% (cap rate expansion)
- Interest rates increase 200 bps on floating debt

**Pro Forma Impact:**
- NOI declines to ~$115M (from ~$124M)
- Interest expense increases to ~$73M (from $69M)
- Coverage: $115M / $73M = 1.58x (**below 2.0x threshold**)
- Leverage: $1,079M / $2,350M = 45.9% (**approaching B territory**)
- **Rating implication: Downgrade to Ba3/BB- or B1/B+**

**Probability Assessment:**
- **12-month downgrade probability:** 15-20%
- **Primary risk:** Combination of office market deterioration and refinancing challenges
- **Key leading indicator:** Q3-Q4 2025 occupancy trends and renewal activity

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Factor-by-Factor Assessment

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Assessment | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Business Profile & Competitive Position** | 25% | **3.0** | Adequate | Diversified 9.7M sf portfolio across industrial/office/retail with 87.8% occupancy (89.0% with commitments). Geographic diversification (Canada 48%/US 52%) reduces single-market risk. However, elevated office exposure (54.7%) faces structural headwinds. Portfolio positioned in secondary markets vs. trophy assets. |
| **Financial Policy & Capital Allocation** | 15% | **3.5** | Adequate+ | Management demonstrating improved discipline: $51.7M dispositions in H1 2025, $200M debenture repayment, and accretive NCIB (3.8M units @ $7.42 vs. NAV $12.98 = 43% discount). Vision focused on "strengthening balance sheet" and "value investing." However, distribution policy remains aggressive at 176.5% AFFO payout ratio. |
| **Leverage & Coverage Metrics** | 35% | **2.5** | Weak+ | Debt/Assets 41.3% sits at upper end of Ba range (typically 40-50%). Net Debt/Assets 40.7% shows modest cash position. NOI/Interest coverage of 1.8x and EBITDA/Interest 2.31x both fall within Ba range (2.0-3.25x) but leave limited cushion. Interest expense of $68.7M annualized represents significant fixed charge burden. |
| **Liquidity & Refinancing Risk** | 20% | **2.0** | Weak | **Critical concern:** Revolving credit facility fully drawn at $437.6M with limited cushion. Cash balance only $16.6M provides minimal buffer. Near-term liquidity dependent on asset sale execution and refinancing capability. No disclosed undrawn capacity. Positive: Recent track record of accessing capital markets. |
| **Asset Quality & Portfolio Fundamentals** | 5% | **3.5** | Good | Portfolio generating solid same-property NOI growth (2.3% for 6M 2025). Weighted-average renewal rent increase of 3.6% in Q2 indicates positive rental momentum. Occupancy 87.8% (89.0% with commitments) is adequate but below investment-grade standards (>90%). Total GBV $2.6B provides meaningful scale. |

### **Composite Scorecard Score: 2.88 / 5.0**

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating: Ba2/BB**

This aligns with the DBRS rating of BB (high) and reflects:
- Adequate business profile offset by elevated office exposure
- Improving financial discipline constrained by unsustainable distribution policy
- Weak leverage/coverage metrics at the aggressive end of speculative-grade range
- Significant liquidity and refinancing risk from fully drawn revolver
- Good portfolio fundamentals with positive operating momentum

## Key Observations

### 9.1 **Primary Credit Story**

Artis REIT is a **mid-sized, diversified real estate investment trust** operating a $2.6B portfolio of industrial, office, and retail properties across Canada and the United States. The credit profile is characterized by:

**Strengths:**
- Solid asset management capabilities with positive same-property NOI growth (2.3%) and rental momentum (+3.6% renewals)
- Geographic diversification reducing single-market concentration risk
- Demonstrated financial discipline through strategic asset sales, debt repayment, and accretive buybacks
- Meaningful scale providing access to capital markets

**Weaknesses:**
- Elevated leverage (41.3% Debt/Assets) at upper end of speculative-grade range
- Weak interest coverage (2.31x EBITDA/Interest) leaving minimal cushion
- **Critical concern:** Unsustainable distribution policy (176.5% AFFO payout)
- Fully drawn revolving facility creating liquidity and refinancing risk
- High office exposure (54.7% GLA) during structural sector transition

### 9.2 **Rating Rationale**

The **Ba2/BB** (high speculative grade) rating reflects:

1. **Adequate business profile:** Diversified portfolio with acceptable occupancy and operating performance, offset by elevated office exposure

2. **Improving financial policy:** Management demonstrating better discipline, though distribution policy remains aggressive

3. **Weak leverage and coverage:** Metrics at aggressive end of Ba range with limited cushion

4. **Liquidity constraints:** Fully drawn revolver and minimal cash create refinancing dependency

5. **Good portfolio fundamentals:** Positive NOI growth and rental momentum provide operational stability

### 9.3 **Critical Success Factors for Credit Quality Improvement**

For Artis to achieve investment-grade rating (Baa3/BBB-), management must execute on:

**Priority 1: Distribution Rationalization**
- Reduce distribution to $0.30-0.35 per unit (sustainable ~85-100% AFFO payout)
- Free up $25-30M annually for deleveraging
- **Timeline:** Within next 6-12 months

**Priority 2: Accelerated Deleveraging**
- Execute $150-200M asset sales over 18-24 months
- Apply proceeds to debt reduction (target Debt/Assets <38%)
- Focus dispositions on non-core or office properties to rebalance portfolio
- **Timeline:** 18-24 months

**Priority 3: Liquidity Enhancement**
- Extend revolving credit facility maturity to >3 years
- Create $75-100M undrawn capacity through debt paydown
- Maintain cash balance >$25M
- **Timeline:** Before existing revolver maturity (timing unknown but likely within 12-24 months)

**Priority 4: Portfolio Repositioning**
- Reduce office exposure to <50% GLA through selective sales
- Increase industrial/flex exposure through strategic acquisitions or organic development
- **Timeline:** 24-36 months

### 9.4 **Risk Assessment Summary**

**Near-Term Risks (12 months):**
- Revolving facility refinancing if maturity approaching
- Covenant compliance if coverage deteriorates
- Distribution cut likely required (negative equity market reaction but positive credit development)

**Medium-Term Risks (1-3 years):**
- Office market deterioration impacting occupancy/rental rates
- Asset sale execution challenges (pricing below book value)
- Interest rate environment affecting refinancing costs

**Mitigating Factors:**
- DBRS BB (high) rating with stable trend suggests recent third-party validation of credit profile
- Management track record of capital markets access ($200M debenture repayment)
- Positive operating momentum (same-property NOI growth, rental increases)
- Geographic diversification providing strategic flexibility

### 9.5 **Bondholders vs. Unitholders: Interest Alignment**

The **unsustainable distribution policy** creates a **misalignment of interests** between equity unitholders and creditors:

**Unitholders benefit from:**
- High current yield (12% based on $5 unit price / $0.60 distribution)
- Delayed recognition of fundamental weakness

**Creditors bear risk from:**
- Operating cash flow diverted to distributions rather than debt service/deleveraging
- Depleted financial flexibility in stress scenarios
- Heightened refinancing risk

**Resolution:**
A **distribution cut is inevitable** and would represent a **credit-positive development**, signaling management prioritization of balance sheet strength and creditor protection over short-term equity yield maintenance.

### 9.6 **Investment Thesis (From Credit Perspective)**

**For Bond/Loan Investors:**

**Current Positioning:**
- DBRS BB (high) rating suggests current spreads likely in +300 to +450 bps range over government benchmarks (estimated)
- Risk/return profile appropriate for **high-yield credit allocation** with tolerance for speculative-grade risk

**Relative Value:**
- **Fair value** at current rating level given elevated leverage and weak coverage
- Potential for **spread tightening** if management executes on deleveraging and distribution cut
- **Downside risk:** Spread widening if office market deteriorates or refinancing challenges emerge

**Hold/Buy Recommendation:**
- **Existing holders:** Maintain position with close monitoring of quarterly occupancy and asset sale execution
- **New investors:** Attractive entry point IF conviction that distribution will be cut and deleveraging will accelerate
- **Risk tolerance:** Appropriate only for investors comfortable with Ba2/BB credit risk and potential volatility

## Appendix A: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```
