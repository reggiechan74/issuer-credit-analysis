## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust faces severe liquidity stress despite executing a strategic portfolio repositioning strategy. With Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3% (upper-Baa/lower-Ba range) and critically weak NOI/Interest coverage of 1.8x (Ba category), the REIT's financial profile is constrained by an acute cash runway crisis. Available cash of $16.6 million provides only 2.1 months of runway at the current burn rate of $8.0 million/month, creating imminent refinancing risk. While asset dispositions totaling $47.4 million in Q2 2025 demonstrate progress on deleveraging, the pace of sales has been insufficient to stabilize the balance sheet before cash depletion. The REIT's survival depends on accelerating non-core asset sales, accessing credit facilities ($78.4 million undrawn), or emergency equity issuance within the next 60-90 days.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. **Critical liquidity risk:** 2.1-month cash runway requires immediate financing action
2. **Weak interest coverage:** 1.8x NOI/Interest coverage signals operating cash flow stress
3. **Moderate leverage:** 41.3% Debt/Assets sits at lower end of Ba range
4. **Portfolio repositioning underway:** $47.4M in Q2 dispositions, but pace must accelerate

---

## Credit Strengths

1. **Active deleveraging through asset sales**: Artis generated $47.4 million in disposition proceeds during Q2 2025, demonstrating management's commitment to balance sheet improvement. The REIT continues to evaluate opportunistic sales of industrial, office, and retail assets at or above IFRS values.

2. **Positive AFCF generation despite stress**: Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) of $50.3 million ($0.52/unit diluted) demonstrates that asset monetization is generating positive free cash flow after all investing activities, providing a critical funding source for debt service.

3. **Minimal equity dilution**: Share dilution of only 1.28% from restricted units (721k) and deferred units (527k) reflects disciplined compensation practices with no convertible debt overhang. Enhanced disclosure (MD&A page 30) signals strong governance.

4. **Diversified portfolio by asset class**: 83 properties totaling 9.7 million sq ft across industrial, office, and retail reduces single-sector concentration risk during the repositioning phase.

5. **Same-property NOI growth positive**: 2.3% same-property NOI growth demonstrates operational resilience despite portfolio challenges, indicating management's ability to drive organic revenue growth from stabilized assets.

---

---

## Credit Challenges

1. **Critical liquidity crisis - going concern risk**: With only $16.6 million in available cash and a monthly burn rate of $8.0 million, Artis faces cash depletion by late August 2025 (2.1 months runway). Even with access to $78.4 million in undrawn credit facilities, extended runway is only 11.8 months. This creates forced seller dynamics and severely constrains negotiating leverage for refinancing or asset sales.

2. **Insufficient debt service coverage**: NOI/Interest coverage of 1.8x falls well short of the 2.5-3.0x minimum typically required by investment-grade standards. AFCF Debt Service Coverage of only 0.81x means free cash flow cannot support debt obligations without asset sales or new financing, confirming reliance on capital markets.

3. **Unsustainable distribution policy**: AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% (issuer-reported) is deeply unsustainable, requiring distributions to be funded from asset sales rather than operating cash flow. While AFCF payout ratio of 71.9% appears healthier, it still relies on continued disposition activity to maintain distributions.

4. **Large variance between reported and calculated REIT metrics**: Issuer-reported FFO of $34.5M vastly exceeds calculated FFO of $4.0M (-88.5% variance), and reported AFFO of $16.9M exceeds calculated AFFO of $4.0M (-76.7% variance). These material discrepancies raise concerns about methodology transparency and may indicate aggressive adjustments that overstate cash flow available for distributions.

---

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

The Negative outlook reflects acute near-term refinancing risk driven by the critical liquidity position. Artis must execute at least $150-200 million in asset sales over the next 12 months AND suspend or materially reduce distributions to avoid covenant breaches or forced restructuring. Failure to access additional liquidity (credit facilities, emergency equity raise, or accelerated sales) within 60-90 days could trigger going concern warnings.

**Stabilization requires:**
- Immediate distribution suspension or 50%+ reduction (saving $36M annually)
- $150-200M in asset sales at book value or better by Q2 2026
- Successful refinancing of 2026-2027 debt maturities without covenant defaults
- Occupancy improvement to 92%+ through leasing momentum
- NOI/Interest coverage recovery to 2.2x+ minimum

**Downside scenario (40% probability):** Unable to execute sufficient asset sales before cash depletion; forced to access high-cost bridge financing or distressed asset sales at 10-20% discounts; distribution suspension triggers unit price decline and equity raise becomes dilutive; downgrade to CCC+/B- range.

---



**Stabilization Criteria:** Not specified

---

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

**Upgrade to B+/Stable or BB- would require:**

1. **Liquidity restoration:** Cash runway extended to 18+ months through combination of:
   - $200M+ in asset sales at or above book value
   - Distribution suspension or reduction to 50% of AFFO
   - Available cash increased to $75M+ with full credit facility headroom

2. **Coverage improvement:** NOI/Interest coverage sustained above 2.2x for two consecutive quarters through:
   - Occupancy gains to 92%+ from leasing success
   - Interest expense reduction via debt paydown
   - Same-property NOI growth maintained at 2-3% annually

3. **Deleveraging trajectory:** Debt/Gross Assets reduced below 38% (mid-Baa range) with credible path to 35% within 24 months

4. **Demonstrated refinancing access:** Successful renewal of 2026 maturities on favorable terms without covenant amendments

**Timeframe:** 18-24 months, contingent on immediate stabilization actions

---

---

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

**Downgrade to CCC+/B- would be triggered by:**

1. **Covenant breach or default:** Violation of debt covenants (likely Debt/Assets or coverage minimums) requiring waiver or amendment
   - **Trigger threshold:** Debt/Assets >50% or Coverage <1.5x

2. **Cash runway depletion:** Available cash falls below $10 million without new financing secured
   - **Current buffer:** Only $6.6M above trigger ($16.6M current)

3. **Forced asset sales at material discounts:** Disposition activity at 15%+ discount to IFRS book values, indicating distressed selling
   - **Current:** Q2 sales at or near book value, but urgency may force discounts

4. **Distribution suspension without offsetting positives:** While necessary, distribution cut without credible refinancing plan would signal severe stress

5. **Extended runway < 6 months:** If credit facilities are drawn and total liquidity runway remains below 6 months

**Downgrade Trigger Summary:**

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer to Trigger |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Cash Depletion | <$10M | $16.6M | -$6.6M (40% buffer) |
| NOI/Interest Coverage | <1.5x | 1.8x | -0.3x (17% buffer) |
| Debt/Assets | >50% | 41.3% | +8.7pp (21% buffer) |
| Cash Runway | <3 months | 2.1 months | **ALREADY BREACHED** |

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Ba | 3/5 | Gross assets of $2.61B place Artis in Ba category ($2-5B range). Scale is adequate for diversified REIT but insufficient for Baa rating. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Ba/B | 2.5/5 | **Asset Quality (Ba):** Diversified portfolio (83 properties, 9.7M sf) across industrial, office, retail. Secondary markets with occupancy of 87.8% in-place, 89.0% committed - below peer average. **Market Position (B):** Limited pricing power in competitive markets; 2.3% same-property NOI growth is positive but modest. Overall: Lower Ba/Upper B. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | B+ | 2/5 | Severely constrained. $78.4M undrawn credit facilities available but 2.1-month cash runway creates forced seller dynamics. Public markets access limited by unit price stress. Asset sales are primary capital source, creating refinancing risk for 2026-2027 maturities. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Ba | 2.5/5 | **Debt/Assets: 41.3%** sits at lower end of Ba range (45-55%). **NOI/Interest Coverage: 1.8x** is weak for Ba category (2.0-3.0x target). AFCF Debt Service Coverage of 0.81x confirms inability to self-fund debt service. Blended score: Ba- (2.5/5). |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | B | 2/5 | Aggressive distribution policy (176.5% AFFO payout) demonstrates prioritization of yield over balance sheet strength. While asset sales strategy is prudent, execution pace has been too slow to prevent liquidity crisis. NCIB program inappropriate given liquidity stress. Policy is B category (high financial risk). |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **B+** | **2.4/5** | **Indicated rating: B+ (Negative Outlook)** <br><br>Weighted score: (5% × 3) + (25% × 2.5) + (20% × 2) + (35% × 2.5) + (15% × 2) = 2.4/5 = **B+** <br><br>Negative outlook reflects critical liquidity stress (2.1-month runway) and imminent refinancing risk requiring emergency action within 60-90 days. |

**Methodology Note:** Scoring uses 1-5 scale where Aaa=5, Aa=4, A=3, Baa=2.5, Ba=2, B=1.5, Caa=1. Artis scores 2.4/5, indicating upper B+/lower BB- territory with downward pressure.

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**FFO/AFFO Calculation Discrepancy (Material Concern):**

The variance between issuer-reported and REALPAC-calculated metrics is exceptionally large:
- **FFO:** Reported $34.5M vs Calculated $4.0M = **-88.5% variance**
- **AFFO:** Reported $16.9M vs Calculated $4.0M = **-76.7% variance**

This suggests material methodology differences, likely driven by:
1. **Aggressive add-backs:** Issuer may be adding back items not permitted under strict REALPAC methodology (e.g., transaction costs, fair value adjustments, non-recurring items)
2. **JV treatment:** Equity-accounted investments may be treated differently (distributions vs proportionate AFFO)
3. **Reserve methodology:** AFFO uses "reserve methodology" per MD&A (property maintenance reserves based on 2021-2024 actuals + 2025 budget), which may understate actual sustaining capex requirements

**Implication for credit analysis:** The calculated metrics ($4.0M FFO/AFFO) likely provide a more conservative view of sustainable cash flow. Relying on reported metrics overstates distribution coverage and cash generation capacity.

**Distribution Coverage Assessment:**
- **Issuer-reported AFFO payout:** 176.5% = Deeply unsustainable
- **AFCF payout ratio:** 71.9% = Appears healthier but relies on asset sales
- **Calculated AFFO (if accurate):** Would imply >750% payout ratio

**Recommendation:** Distribution suspension or 70%+ reduction is necessary to preserve liquidity.

### Portfolio Quality Observations

1. **Occupancy below peer average:** 87.8% in-place occupancy (89.0% committed) trails peer average of 89-92% for diversified Canadian REITs, indicating leasing challenges.

2. **Positive leasing momentum:** Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% suggests management is achieving modest rent growth despite occupancy headwinds.

3. **Asset sales execution risk:** Q2 disposition of $47.4M (one retail property sold for $4.8M plus other sales) demonstrates ability to transact, but pace must accelerate dramatically to stabilize liquidity.

### Burn Rate and Runway Analysis

**Critical Finding:** Despite positive AFCF of $50.3M (annualized), Artis burns $8.0M per month because free cash flow cannot cover mandatory obligations:
- **Total debt service:** $62.3M (interest $34.4M × 2 + principal repayments)
- **Distributions:** $36.1M annually
- **Net financing needs:** $98.4M
- **AFCF covers only:** 51% of obligations (self-funding ratio 0.51x)

**This creates a structural deficit requiring $48.2M in external financing annually.**

**Runway calculation:**
- Available cash: $16.6M ÷ $8.0M/month = **2.1 months** (depletion by late August 2025)
- Extended runway (w/ credit facilities): $95.0M ÷ $8.0M/month = **11.8 months**

**Sustainable burn rate:** To maintain 24-month runway, maximum monthly burn = $693k/month. Actual burn of $8.0M/month is **11.6x sustainable rate**, requiring immediate corrective action.

### Dilution Analysis

Share dilution of 1.28% from equity compensation (restricted units 721k, deferred units 527k) is minimal and typical for REITs. No convertible debt overhang. Enhanced disclosure in MD&A page 30 with detailed unit breakdown demonstrates strong governance practices. This is a **credit positive** as it eliminates forced conversion risk and equity overhang concerns.

- Allied Properties REIT (AP.UN) - Office/urban REIT, high leverage
- H&R REIT (HR.UN) - Diversified REIT, strategic repositioning
- Slate Office REIT (SOT.UN) - Office REIT, high leverage

| Metric | Artis REIT | Dream Office | Allied Properties | H&R REIT | Peer Average |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 41.3% | ~52%* | ~48%* | 45.5% | 48.5% |
| **Interest Coverage** | 1.8x | 1.6x* | ~2.0x* | ~2.5x* | 2.0x |

| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 176.5% | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 87.8% | 77.9% | 84.9% | 89.9% | 84.2% |
| **Same-Property NOI Growth** | 2.3% | N/A | ~3.5%* | 3.4% | 3.5% |

**Sources:**
- **Dream Office REIT:** Q2 2025 results via Morningstar/Yahoo Finance (August 7, 2025). Debt-to-EBITDA 12.52x (converted to estimated Debt/Assets ~52%). In-place occupancy 77.9%, committed 81.9%. FFO $0.62/unit Q2 2025.
- **Allied Properties REIT:** Q2 2025 results via Globe Newswire (July 29, 2025). Targeting Net Debt/EBITDA <10x by end-2025, <9x by end-2026 (implies current ~10x+ = estimated 48% Debt/Assets). Occupancy 84.9% occupied, 87.2% leased. Rental revenue $145M Q2 2025.
- **H&R REIT:** Q2 2025 results via company website (August 13, 2025). Debt/Assets 45.5% (proportionate share). Industrial occupancy 89.9%. Same-property NOI +3.4%. FFO $0.61/unit.
- **Slate Office REIT:** Q2 2024 results (latest available) via Business Wire (August 2024). LTV 83.2% indicates severe distress.

### Peer Analysis

**Where Artis Ranks:**

1. **Leverage (Debt/Assets 41.3%):** Artis has the **lowest leverage** among peers, which is a relative strength. However, this is offset by weakest coverage.

2. **Coverage (1.8x):** Artis ties with Dream Office for **weakest interest coverage** among peers. Allied and H&R maintain 2.0-2.5x, providing more cushion.

3. **Occupancy (87.8%):** Artis ranks **2nd among peers**, ahead of Dream Office (77.9%) and Allied (84.9%), but behind H&R (89.9%). Committed occupancy of 89.0% suggests improving trend.

4. **Same-Property NOI Growth (2.3%):** Artis **lags peers** with 2.3% vs 3.4-3.5% for H&R and Allied, indicating weaker pricing power or higher tenant turnover.

5. **Distribution Policy:** Artis's 176.5% AFFO payout ratio is extreme compared to peers' FFO payout ratios of 88-110%, confirming unsustainable distribution policy.

### Rating Positioning Assessment

**Is B+ rating appropriate?**

Yes. Artis's B+ rating reflects:
- **Lower leverage than peers** (positive) offset by **weakest coverage** (negative)
- **Critical liquidity crisis** (2.1-month runway) not yet reflected in most peer situations
- **Unsustainable distribution policy** requiring imminent correction
- **Execution risk** on asset sales in competitive market environment

**Peer rating context (estimated):**
- Dream Office: Likely B/B- (weakest occupancy, high leverage)
- Allied Properties: Likely BB-/B+ (high leverage but stronger operations)
- H&R REIT: Likely BB/BB- (better balance sheet, repositioning progress)
- Slate Office: Likely B/CCC (83.2% LTV indicates severe distress)

**Artis differentiators:**
- **Lower leverage** (41.3% vs 45-52% peers) provides rating support
- **Critical cash runway** (2.1 months) is unique weakness requiring Negative outlook
- **Asset sale execution** will determine rating trajectory over next 12 months

**Vision (per MD&A):** "To become a best-in-class real estate asset management and investment platform focused on value investing."

---

### Business Strategy

**Strategic Positioning:** Artis is executing a **repositioning/deleveraging strategy** focused on portfolio simplification, balance sheet strengthening, and NAV per unit growth. This is a defensive strategy driven by legacy leverage and changing market conditions requiring asset base rationalization.

**Core Strategic Pillars (per Q2 2025 MD&A):**

### 1. Asset Monetization and Portfolio Optimization

**Objective:** Unlock value through opportunistic dispositions at or above IFRS values

**Execution:**
- Sold one retail property in Canada for $4.8M during Q2 2025
- Total disposition proceeds of $47.4M in Q2 (including other transactions)
- Targeting sale of industrial, office, and retail non-core assets on opportunistic basis
- Focus on maximizing value on tax-efficient basis

**Assessment:** Progress is evident but pace is insufficient given liquidity constraints. Asset sales must accelerate to $150-200M over next 12 months to stabilize balance sheet.

### 2. Balance Sheet Strengthening

**Objective:** Generate meaningful long-term growth in net asset value per unit by strengthening balance sheet

**Tactics:**
- Apply disposition proceeds to debt reduction
- Improve leverage metrics (Debt/Assets currently 41.3%, targeting reduction to <38%)
- Enhance covenant compliance buffers
- Preserve access to credit facilities

**Assessment:** Intention is sound but execution lagging due to liquidity burn rate. Distribution policy undermines balance sheet strengthening by diverting cash to unitholders rather than debt reduction.

### 3. Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)

**Objective:** Enhance unitholder value through unit buybacks

**Authorization (renewed December 19, 2024):**
- Up to 4,975,917 common units
- Up to 291,560 Series E preferred units
- Up to 421,775 Series I preferred units

**Assessment:** **Inappropriate capital allocation given liquidity crisis.** NCIB deployment should be suspended immediately to preserve cash. Buybacks make sense only when units trade at material discount to NAV AND the REIT has excess liquidity, neither of which applies to Artis currently.

### 4. Organic Growth and Value Investing

**Objective:** Drive organic growth through active asset management and leasing

**Evidence:**
- Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% demonstrates operational improvement
- Occupancy increased from 87.8% in-place to 89.0% committed (leasing momentum)
- Focus on "highest and best risk-adjusted return opportunities"

**Assessment:** Operational performance is relatively strong given headwinds, but organic growth alone cannot solve structural liquidity deficit.

---

### Strategic Assessment: Deleveraging/Repositioning Strategy

**Strategy Classification:** **Reposition** - Sell non-core assets, focus portfolio, reduce debt

**Evidence from metrics:**
- Asset sales activity: $47.4M in Q2 dispositions
- Positive AFCF: Free cash flow generation of $50.3M driven by sale proceeds
- Deleveraging intent: Debt/Assets of 41.3% down from higher levels (direction correct)
- Distribution policy misaligned: 176.5% AFFO payout contradicts balance sheet strengthening
- Execution pace insufficient: Monthly burn rate of $8.0M requires 3-5x faster asset sale pace

**Comparable strategy examples:**
- **H&R REIT:** Executing similar repositioning with $121.6M sales in H1 2025, more aggressive distribution management
- **Allied Properties:** Targeting Net Debt/EBITDA <10x by end-2025 through $300M+ non-core sales
- **Artis:** Similar strategic playbook but behind peers on execution timeline

**Strategic Risks:**
1. **Market timing risk:** Commercial real estate transaction volumes remain muted; may need to accept discounts to accelerate sales
2. **Forced seller dynamics:** 2.1-month cash runway creates negotiating disadvantage
3. **Distribution policy inertia:** Unitholders may resist distribution cuts, but cuts are mandatory for survival
4. **Refinancing risk:** 2026-2027 debt maturities must be addressed before liquidity depletes

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Suspend distributions immediately** (save $36M annually) and redirect cash to debt reduction
2. **Accelerate asset sales** to $40-50M per quarter ($160-200M annually) even if requires 5-10% discounts
3. **Suspend NCIB program** to preserve liquidity
4. **Engage refinancing discussions early** for 2026-2027 maturities to avoid last-minute scramble
5. **Consider strategic alternatives** if asset sale pace remains insufficient (merger, portfolio sale, REIT conversion to REOC)

#### 2.1 Overview

This section analyzes the issuer's recurring economic earnings (FFO/AFFO), sustainable cash flow (ACFO), and adjusted free cash flow (AFCF) metrics, providing comprehensive earnings-based and cash flow-based perspectives on distribution sustainability and capital markets reliance.

**Metric Definitions:**
- **FFO (Funds From Operations)**: Earnings metric starting from IFRS Net Income, adjusted for non-cash items per REALPAC (January 2022)
- **AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations)**: FFO adjusted for sustaining capital requirements (earnings-based recurring income)
- **ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations)**: Cash flow metric starting from IFRS CFO, adjusted per REALPAC (January 2023)
- **AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow)**: ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities (most conservative free cash flow measure)

#### 4.2 Sources and Uses

**Sources:**
- Cash on hand: 16,639 CAD thousands
- Operating cash flow: Based on NOI of Not provided separately (incorporated in coverage metrics) CAD thousands (quarterly)
- ACFO (sustainable cash flow): 7,198 CAD thousands (Q2 2025)

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** Yes

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the forward-looking speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves based on current run rate. This is a **liquidity stress test** assuming NO future access to capital markets. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions).

**Formula:**
```
Mandatory Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (period amounts)
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period
```

**Note:** New financing is NOT subtracted - burn rate assumes no future capital raises.

**Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Reporting Period | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **AFCF (Period)** | 50,252 | Q2 2025 | Free cash flow |
| **Mandatory Obligations:** | | | |
| - Total Debt Service | 62,288 | Q2 2025 | Interest + Principal |
| - Total Distributions | 36,144 | Q2 2025 | Common + Preferred |
| **Total Obligations** | 98,432 | Q2 2025 | - |
| **Period Deficit/(Surplus)** | -48,180 | Q2 2025 | AFCF - Obligations |
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | -8,030 | Per month | 6-month period |

**Self-Funding Analysis:**
- **Self-Funding Ratio:** 0.51x (AFCF / Mandatory Obligations)
- **Interpretation:** Moderate capital markets reliance
- **Capital Markets Reliance:** Requires $48,180 external financing (49% of obligations)

**Liquidity Position:**

| Liquidity Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Cash and Cash Equivalents** | 16,639 | End of period |
| **Marketable Securities** | 0 | Liquid investments |
| **Less: Restricted Cash** | (0) | Not available for operations |
| **Available Cash** | 16,639 | Immediately available |
| **Undrawn Credit Facilities** | 78,400 | Remaining capacity |
| **Total Available Liquidity** | 95,039 | Cash + facilities |

**Cash Runway Analysis:**

| Scenario | Liquidity Base | Runway (Months) | Runway (Years) | Depletion Date | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash Only** | 16,639 | 2.1 | 0.2 | 2025-08-31 | CRITICAL |
| **Extended** (w/ facilities) | 95,039 | 11.8 | 1.0 | 2026-06-19 | CRITICAL |

**Runway Calculation:**
- **Cash Only:** Available Cash (16,639) ÷ Monthly Burn (8,030) = 2.1 months
- **Extended:** Total Liquidity (95,039) ÷ Monthly Burn (8,030) = 11.8 months

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Risk Level | Risk Score | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | CRITICAL | 4/4 | 🚨 Critical Risk - Immediate financing required (< 6 months) |

**Risk Thresholds:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (Score 4): < 6 months runway - Immediate financing required
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (Score 3): 6-12 months runway - Near-term capital raise needed
- ⚠️ **MODERATE** (Score 2): 12-24 months runway - Plan financing within 12 months
- ✓ **LOW** (Score 1): > 24 months runway - Adequate liquidity runway

**Warning Flags:**
None identified

**Recommendations:**
- Suspend or reduce distributions immediately
- Accelerate non-core asset sales
- Pursue emergency financing (bridge loan, equity raise)
- Defer all non-critical capital expenditures
- Engage restructuring advisors

**Sustainable Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Target Runway** | 24 months | Management target |
| **Sustainable Monthly Burn** | 693 | Maximum sustainable burn rate |
| **Actual Monthly Burn** | -8,030 | Current burn rate |
| **Excess/(Deficit) Burn** | 7,337 | Above sustainable - Overspending by $7,337/month |

**Burn Rate Interpretation:**
AFCF of $50,252 covers 51% of mandatory obligations ($98,432). Monthly cash deficit of $8,030 must be funded through capital markets or asset sales.

**Credit Implications:**
⚠️ Moderate - Partial reliance on capital markets for financing obligations

#### 4.4 Liquidity Assessment

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case (50-60% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of $150-200M at book value executed by Q2 2026
- Distribution reduction to $0.15/unit (50% cut) implemented by Q4 2025
- Occupancy stabilizes at 88-90% with modest leasing gains
- Same-property NOI growth 2.0-2.5% maintained
- Access to credit facilities to bridge timing gaps

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- Debt/Assets: **37-38%** (from 41.3%) - deleveraging via asset sales
- NOI/Interest Coverage: **2.0-2.2x** (from 1.8x) - reduced debt service from paydowns
- Cash Runway: **18-24 months** (from 2.1 months) - sale proceeds + distribution savings
- AFCF Self-Funding Ratio: **0.75-0.85x** (from 0.51x) - improved but still reliant on financing

**Rating Impact:** Rating stabilizes at B+ with outlook revised to STABLE after 12-18 months. Potential for upgrade to BB- if execution exceeds expectations.

**Key execution milestones:**
- Q4 2025: Announce distribution reduction, secure $50M+ in asset sales
- Q1 2026: Complete $100M+ in cumulative sales, demonstrate covenant compliance
- Q2 2026: Achieve $150M+ in total sales, coverage >2.0x, runway >18 months

---

### Upside Case (20-30% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Aggressive asset sales of $250-300M at 5-10% premiums to book value by Q2 2026
- Distribution suspended entirely (saving $36M annually)
- Occupancy recovery to 92-94% through successful leasing campaign
- Same-property NOI growth accelerates to 3.5-4.0% (market recovery)
- Early refinancing of 2026-2027 maturities on favorable terms

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- Debt/Assets: **32-34%** - substantial deleveraging
- NOI/Interest Coverage: **2.5-2.8x** - materially improved cash flow
- Cash Runway: **36+ months** - fully stabilized liquidity position
- AFCF Self-Funding Ratio: **>1.0x** - achieves self-funding status

**Rating Impact:** Upgrade to **BB-/Positive** within 12-18 months, with path to BB/Stable within 24 months.

**Upside catalysts:**
- Favorable market conditions for asset sales (cap rate compression, buyer demand)
- Major lease renewals or new tenant wins driving occupancy >92%
- Successful disposal of entire non-core portfolio at premiums
- Equity raise at favorable pricing to accelerate deleveraging

---

### Downside Case (10-20% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales total only $75-100M at 10% discount to book value (distressed selling)
- Distribution maintained at current level (delayed decision)
- Occupancy declines to 84-86% due to tenant defaults or non-renewals
- Same-property NOI growth flat to negative (-0.5% to 0%)
- Credit facilities fully drawn by Q4 2025

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- Debt/Assets: **44-46%** - limited deleveraging progress
- NOI/Interest Coverage: **1.5-1.6x** - deteriorating coverage
- Cash Runway: **6-8 months** (extended only) - approaching critical threshold
- AFCF Self-Funding Ratio: **0.35-0.40x** - increased financing dependence

**Rating Impact:** Downgrade to **B/Negative** within 6 months, with risk of further downgrade to B- or CCC+ if conditions worsen.

**Downgrade triggers:**
- Covenant breach requiring waiver/amendment
- Forced asset sales at >15% discount to book
- Inability to access credit facilities due to covenant restrictions
- Distribution suspension without credible refinancing plan

---

### Stress Case (5-10% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Severe recession: NOI declines 12-15% due to tenant defaults and rent concessions
- Asset sales freeze: Unable to transact at acceptable prices (<$50M total proceeds)
- Major tenant bankruptcy (e.g., top 5 tenant representing 3-5% of NOI)
- Credit facilities unavailable due to covenant breach
- Forced to seek DIP financing or restructuring

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- Debt/Assets: **52-55%** - asset value write-downs + limited deleveraging
- NOI/Interest Coverage: **<1.2x** - approaching covenant default
- Cash Runway: **<3 months** without emergency financing
- AFCF: **Negative** - operating cash flow insufficient to cover debt service

**Rating Impact:** Multi-notch downgrade to **CCC+/CCC** (high default risk) with Negative outlook. Potential for formal restructuring or distressed debt exchange.

**Stress scenario indicators:**
- GDP contraction >2% with commercial real estate cap rate expansion
- Credit market freeze limiting REIT access to capital
- Tenant bankruptcy wave (office sector particularly vulnerable)
- Covenant breach triggering cross-default provisions

### Downgrade Trigger Summary

| Trigger | Threshold | Base Case | Downside Case | Stress Case | Current Buffer |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cash Runway** | <6 months | 18-24 mo | 6-8 mo | <3 mo | **-3.9 mo (BREACH)** |
| **NOI/Int Coverage** | <1.5x | 2.0-2.2x | 1.5-1.6x | <1.2x | +0.3x (17%) |
| **Debt/Assets** | >50% | 37-38% | 44-46% | 52-55% | +8.7pp (21%) |
| **AFCF Self-Fund** | <0.40x | 0.75-0.85x | 0.35-0.40x | Negative | +0.11x (22%) |

**CRITICAL:** Cash runway trigger is already breached (2.1 months < 6 months minimum). This drives the Negative outlook and requires immediate stabilization actions to avoid downgrade.

### Key Limitations

1. **Single Point-in-Time Analysis:** Based on Q2 2025 data only
2. **Limited Historical Data:** Trend analysis requires multi-period data
3. **No Management Guidance:** Forward-looking assumptions not validated by management
4. **Incomplete Debt Schedule:** Maturity profile and covenant details not reviewed
5. **No Market Comparables:** Peer analysis not performed
6. **Limited ESG Data:** Property-level environmental and social metrics not available
7. **Forward-Looking Uncertainty:** Scenario analysis based on assumptions that may not materialize

### Professional Caveats

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:**

- This is credit analysis, **NOT investment advice**
- Final rating decisions require credit committee review and approval
- Analysis based on data from a single reporting period
- Forward-looking statements involve uncertainty and assumptions
- Professional review by qualified credit analysts recommended before any credit decision
- This analysis should not be relied upon as the sole basis for credit decisions
- Additional due diligence required for investment-grade rating confirmation

## Appendix B: Moody's-Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

Not available

---

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

**Total Debt Service:**
```
Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Where:
  Annualized Interest = Interest expense for the reporting period (annualized)
  Principal Repayments = Scheduled principal payments for the reporting period

Note: Period amounts should be consistent (e.g., all quarterly or all annual)
```

**NOI / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
NOI / Debt Service Coverage = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight debt service coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient debt service coverage
```

**EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage = EBITDA / Total Debt Service

Where:
  EBITDA = NOI (for REITs, NOI approximates EBITDA)
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Note: For REITs, NOI/Debt Service and EBITDA/Debt Service are equivalent
```

**FFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
FFO / Debt Service Coverage = FFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.5x = Strong coverage
  ≥ 2.0x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Moderate coverage
  < 1.5x = Weak coverage
```

**AFFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFFO / Debt Service Coverage = AFFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong coverage (significant cushion after sustaining capex)
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient coverage
```

**ACFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
ACFO / Debt Service Coverage = ACFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.5x = Strong coverage (cash flow based)
  ≥ 1.25x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (cannot cover debt service from operating cash)
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**
```
FFO = IFRS Net Income
    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```

**AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow):**
```
AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Where:
  ACFO = Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (per REALPAC 2023)
  Net CFI = Cash Flow from Investing Activities (IFRS statement)
            Including: Development CAPEX, acquisitions/dispositions,
                      JV capital contributions/returns

IMPORTANT - Double-Counting Prevention:
  ACFO already deducts:
    - Sustaining CAPEX (Adjustment 4)
    - Sustaining TI (Adjustment 6)
    - External leasing costs (Adjustment 5)

  CFI should ONLY include:
    - Development/growth CAPEX (NOT sustaining)
    - Property acquisitions and dispositions
    - JV capital contributions/returns (NOT distributions)
    - Business combinations
```

**AFCF Per Unit:**
```
AFCF per Unit (Basic) = AFCF / Common Units Outstanding (weighted average)

AFCF per Unit (Diluted) = AFCF / Diluted Units Outstanding (weighted average)

Where:
  Diluted Units = Basic Units + Dilutive Instruments
  Dilutive Instruments = RSUs + DSUs + Options + Convertible Debt + Warrants
```

### AFCF Coverage Metrics

**AFCF Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFCF Debt Service Coverage = AFCF / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (can cover debt service from free cash flow)
  < 1.0x = Reliant on capital markets for debt service
```

**AFCF Payout Ratio:**
```
AFCF Payout Ratio = (Total Distributions / AFCF) × 100

Assessment Thresholds:
  < 100% = Distributions sustainable from free cash flow
  ≥ 100% = Distributions exceed free cash flow
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Ratio:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Where:
  Total Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (per reporting period)

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no capital markets reliance)
  0.8-1.0x = Low reliance on external financing
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate reliance on capital markets
  < 0.5x = High reliance on capital markets

Note: Does NOT subtract new financing - measures inherent cash generation capacity
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Capacity:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Capacity = AFCF - (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Interpretation:
  Positive = Surplus cash after all financing obligations
  Negative = Deficit requiring external financing
```

### Burn Rate and Cash Runway Metrics

**Burn Rate Applicability:**
```
Burn Rate applies when: AFCF < Total Financing Obligations

Where:
  Total Financing Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions

Note: A REIT can have positive AFCF but still burn cash if free cash flow
      is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations.
```

**Monthly Burn Rate:**
```
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period

Where:
  Mandatory Obligations = Total Debt Service + Total Distributions
  New financing is NOT subtracted (assumes no future capital raises)
```

**Self-Funding Ratio (Burn Rate Context):**
```
Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / Mandatory Obligations

Interpretation:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no burn rate - generates surplus)
  0.8-1.0x = Low burn rate (nearly self-funding)
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate burn rate (moderate capital markets reliance)
  < 0.5x = High burn rate (high capital markets reliance)
```

**Cash Runway:**
```
Available Cash = Cash + Marketable Securities - Restricted Cash

Cash Runway (months) = Available Cash / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Extended Runway = (Available Cash + Undrawn Facilities) / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Where:
  Undrawn Facilities = Remaining credit facility capacity
  |Monthly Burn Rate| = Absolute value of monthly burn rate
```

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**
```
Risk Level based on Cash Runway:
  < 6 months    = CRITICAL (Score 4) - Immediate financing required
  6-12 months   = HIGH (Score 3) - Near-term capital raise needed
  12-24 months  = MODERATE (Score 2) - Plan financing within 12 months
  > 24 months   = LOW (Score 1) - Adequate liquidity runway
```

**Sustainable Burn Rate:**
```
Target Runway = 24 months (default)
Sustainable Monthly Burn = Available Cash / Target Runway

Excess Burn = Actual Monthly Burn - Sustainable Monthly Burn

Status:
  Excess Burn < 0 = Below sustainable (cash cushion)
  Excess Burn > 0 = Above sustainable (corrective action needed)
```

### Coverage Quality Assessment

**Distribution Coverage Assessment:**
```
Coverage Quality (applies to FFO/AFFO/ACFO/AFCF coverage):

  ≥ 1.3x = Strong coverage (30%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.1x = Adequate coverage (10%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage (< 10% cushion)
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (distributions exceed metric)
```

**Payout Ratio Assessment:**
```
Payout Ratio Quality (inverse of coverage):

  ≤ 77% = Strong (< 77% payout = 1.3x+ coverage)
  ≤ 91% = Adequate (< 91% payout = 1.1x+ coverage)
  < 100% = Tight (< 100% payout = 1.0x+ coverage)
  ≥ 100% = Insufficient (payout exceeds metric)
```
