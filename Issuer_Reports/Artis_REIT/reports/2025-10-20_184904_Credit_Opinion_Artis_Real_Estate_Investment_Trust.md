## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / BB (Moody's / S&P Equivalent)

**Credit Story:**

Artis REIT is executing a controlled portfolio runoff strategy characterized by systematic asset dispositions ($47.4M in H1 2025) that have temporarily enhanced AFCF but revealed fundamental distribution sustainability challenges. With an AFFO payout ratio of 176.5%, the REIT is distributing $1.77 for every dollar of sustainable operating cash flow - a structurally untenable position that signals either imminent distribution cuts or continued asset liquidation to fund unitholder payments. While leverage remains moderate at 41.3% debt-to-assets and same-property NOI growth is positive at 2.3%, the critical weakness is interest coverage of only 1.8x, leaving minimal cushion for operating underperformance. The REIT's strategic pivot from growth to harvest/liquidation mode positions it as a transitional credit requiring close monitoring of distribution policy, asset sale execution, and debt reduction progress.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. See Executive Summary
2. 
3. 
4. 

---

## Credit Strengths

1. **Positive Asset Disposition Execution:** Generated $50.3M in AFCF (including $47.4M from property sales) during H1 2025, demonstrating market liquidity and ability to execute strategic asset sales at acceptable values. AFCF distribution coverage of 1.39x indicates asset sales currently support unitholder payments.

2. **Moderate Leverage Profile:** Debt-to-assets of 41.3% and net debt ratio of 40.7% position Artis in the mid-range of the Baa/Ba rating categories (Baa: 35-45%, Ba: 45-55%), providing some flexibility for debt reduction through asset sales.

3. **Stable Operating Performance:** Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% and occupancy of 89.0% (including commitments) demonstrate portfolio quality remains intact despite strategic runoff, suggesting core assets retain tenant demand and pricing power.

4. **Low Equity Dilution:** Minimal share dilution of 1.28% from normal equity compensation (restricted/deferred units) with no convertible debt overhang, reflecting enhanced governance disclosure and conservative equity structure.

5. **AFCF Surplus Position:** Monthly cash surplus of $9,777 (annualized surplus of $117,329) indicates the REIT currently generates positive free cash flow after all financing obligations, though driven by asset sales rather than operations.

---

---

## Credit Challenges

1. **Critically Unsustainable Distribution:** AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% represents the most severe credit weakness - distributions of $0.30/unit far exceed AFFO generation of $0.17/unit. This 76.5% overpayment is funded by asset sales and debt capacity drawdown, not operations, creating forced seller dynamics and distribution cut risk.

2. **Deteriorating Coverage:** NOI/Interest coverage of 1.8x is below investment grade thresholds (Baa: 3.0-4.0x minimum) and approaches distress territory (Ba: 2.0-3.0x). With annualized interest expense of $137.5M against NOI of only $30.7M (quarterly, implying ~$122.8M annualized), there is minimal cushion for occupancy declines or interest rate increases.

3. **Asset Sale Dependency:** AFCF of $50.3M includes $47.4M of property disposition proceeds - without continued asset sales, AFCF would be negligible. This creates refinancing risk as maturing debt must be repaid through further asset sales, not operations.

4. **Runoff Portfolio Dynamics:** With only 83 properties totaling 9.7M SF, ongoing dispositions reduce scale, operating efficiency, and potentially asset quality if premium properties are sold to fund distributions. Portfolio runoff typically compresses NOI margins and weakens tenant negotiating position.

---

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

**Outlook:** NEGATIVE

**Justification:**

The negative outlook reflects elevated probability (40-50%) of distribution reduction within 12-18 months as the mathematically unsustainable AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% cannot persist without exhausting asset base or violating debt covenants. Three potential scenarios drive the negative bias:

1. **Distribution Cut Scenario (Most Likely - 50% probability):** Management reduces distributions by 40-50% to align with AFFO generation, bringing payout ratio to 80-90%. This would trigger unit price decline but stabilize credit metrics and preserve remaining asset base.

2. **Accelerated Asset Sale Scenario (30% probability):** REIT liquidates additional $200-300M in assets over 12-18 months to fund distributions and reduce debt. This maintains unitholder payments short-term but accelerates portfolio runoff and reduces future cash generation capacity.

3. **Covenant Breach Scenario (20% probability):** Inability to execute asset sales at acceptable values, combined with operating underperformance, leads to debt covenant violations and forced restructuring.

The outlook could stabilize to STABLE if management proactively cuts distributions to sustainable levels (targeting 80-90% AFFO payout) and demonstrates debt reduction of $150M+ over the next 12 months through disciplined asset sales.

---



**Stabilization Criteria:** Not specified

---

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

**Scenario:** Upgrade to Ba1/BB+ would require demonstration of sustainable business model transition from runoff to stable operations

**Specific Thresholds:**

1. **Distribution Alignment:** Reduce AFFO payout ratio to 75-85% range (distributions of $0.13-0.14/unit based on current AFFO of $0.17/unit), demonstrating sustainable distribution policy
2. **Coverage Improvement:** Increase NOI/Interest coverage to ≥2.5x through combination of debt reduction ($150M+) and stable NOI generation
3. **Debt Reduction:** Reduce debt-to-assets to ≤38% (from current 41.3%) through disciplined asset sales, demonstrating deleveraging commitment
4. **Portfolio Stabilization:** Demonstrate 12+ months of stable portfolio (no major asset sales) with same-property NOI growth ≥2.0%, occupancy ≥88%, indicating sustainable operating platform

**Operational Improvements Needed:**

- Articulate clear strategic end-state (target portfolio size, leverage, distribution policy)
- Demonstrate asset sales are strategic repositioning, not forced liquidation
- Stabilize interest coverage through debt reduction and/or NOI growth
- Maintain occupancy above 88% during transition period

---

---

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

**Scenario:** Downgrade to Ba3/BB- would result from distribution policy dysfunction or failed asset sale execution

**Quantified Trigger Points:**

1. **Coverage Deterioration:** NOI/Interest coverage falls below 1.5x (from current 1.8x), indicating insufficient operating cash flow to service debt with adequate buffer
2. **Leverage Increase:** Debt-to-assets exceeds 47% (from current 41.3%), suggesting inability to execute asset sales or value deterioration requiring write-downs
3. **AFFO Decline:** AFFO per unit falls below $0.12/unit (from current $0.17/unit), indicating 30%+ deterioration in sustainable cash flow
4. **Liquidity Stress:** Inability to execute $50M+ of asset sales within a 6-month period, indicating market illiquidity or valuation issues

**Scenarios Pressuring Rating:**

1. **Failed Distribution Cut:** Management maintains unsustainable distribution despite deteriorating metrics, accelerating asset sales and debt capacity erosion
2. **Asset Sale Execution Risk:** Unable to sell properties at book value; forced to realize 10-15% discounts to NAV, triggering covenant pressures
3. **Operating Underperformance:** Same-property NOI growth turns negative due to tenant departures, occupancy falls below 85%, compressing coverage ratios further
4. **Refinancing Wall:** Debt maturities concentrated in 18-24 months cannot be refinanced at acceptable terms, forcing distressed asset sales

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Small | Ba | Gross assets of $2.6B place Artis in Ba category ($2-5B range). Portfolio of 83 properties (9.7M SF) is below peers (Dream Office ~4.4M SF but focused; H&R 25M+ SF diversified). Limited scale reduces operating efficiency and capital markets access. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Moderate Quality | Ba / B | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Ba - Diversified portfolio across office/retail/industrial, but runoff strategy suggests non-core positioning. Occupancy of 89% is below peer averages (93-98% for quality REITs). **Market Position (12.5%):** B - Transitional strategy from growth to harvest/liquidation weakens competitive position. Limited disclosure on geographic concentration and tenant credit quality. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Constrained | B | Refinancing risk elevated due to unsustainable distribution policy limiting equity issuance capacity. Asset sales provide liquidity but deplete capital base. No disclosed undrawn credit facilities in metrics. AFCF debt service coverage of only 0.3x indicates inability to self-fund debt obligations without asset sales - must access capital markets for refinancing. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Weak Coverage | Ba / B | **Debt/Gross Assets:** 41.3% - Upper end of Baa range (35-45%) but acceptable for Ba category. **Interest Coverage:** 1.8x - **CRITICAL WEAKNESS** - Well below Baa minimum (3.0x) and at lower end of Ba range (2.0-3.0x). Provides minimal buffer for adverse conditions. This metric alone constrains rating to Ba/B category. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | Aggressive | B | AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% demonstrates highly aggressive financial policy prioritizing short-term unitholder returns over credit quality and business sustainability. Policy is mathematically unsustainable without continued asset sales. No evidence of proactive deleveraging or distribution reduction despite obvious stress. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Ba2 / BB** | **Ba2** | **Indicated rating: Ba2 (Moody's) / BB (S&P equivalent)** - Weighted assessment reflects moderate leverage offset by critically weak coverage and unsustainable distribution policy. Factor 4 (Leverage & Coverage, 35% weight) drives rating constraint due to 1.8x interest coverage. Factor 5 (Financial Policy, 15% weight) reinforces Ba2 positioning due to aggressive distribution policy. Scale and business profile are consistent with Ba category. |

**Rating Constraint Analysis:**

The **Ba2/BB rating** is primarily constrained by:
1. **Interest coverage of 1.8x** (Factor 4) - prevents investment grade consideration
2. **Unsustainable financial policy** (Factor 5) - AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% creates structural weakness
3. **Refinancing dependency** (Factor 3) - AFCF debt service coverage of 0.3x indicates reliance on external financing

These factors overwhelm the moderately positive leverage positioning (41.3% debt-to-assets) and operational stability (2.3% NOI growth).

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**FFO Generation:**
- FFO of $34.5M ($0.34/unit) for H1 2025 represents baseline operating earnings before growth capital
- FFO payout ratio of 88.2% is elevated but within manageable range (80-90% typical for mature REITs)
- Suggests distributions are approaching FFO capacity but technically covered

**AFFO Sustainability:**
- AFFO of $16.9M ($0.17/unit) after deducting $17.6M of sustaining capital expenditures
- AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is **critically unsustainable** - distributions exceed AFFO by $12.2M (76.5%)
- Implies REIT is either under-investing in portfolio maintenance OR distributions are fundamentally too high
- Typically, investment-grade REITs maintain AFFO payout ratios of 75-85%; distressed REITs exceed 100%

**ACFO Analysis:**
- ACFO of $7.2M ($0.0741/unit) represents cash flow after ALL operating adjustments
- ACFO payout ratio of 404.9% indicates distributions are 4x sustainable operating cash flow
- This extreme ratio suggests ACFO calculation may include significant one-time adjustments OR confirms fundamental distribution stress

**AFCF Bridge:**
- AFCF of $50.3M significantly exceeds ACFO of $7.2M due to $47.4M of property disposition proceeds
- AFCF distribution coverage of 1.39x appears healthy but is **artificially inflated by asset sales**
- On an operations-only basis (ACFO), distribution coverage would be 0.20x - deeply distressed

**Critical Insight:** The gap between FFO payout (88.2%) and AFFO payout (176.5%) indicates Artis is deferring approximately $17.6M of annual sustaining capex/TI/leasing costs. This creates a "hidden debt" that will manifest as:
1. Deferred maintenance reducing asset values
2. Tenant improvement obligations at lease renewals
3. Higher capex requirements in future periods
4. Potential asset sales at discounted values due to capital needs

### Portfolio Quality Assessment

**Occupancy:** 87.8% physical occupancy, 89.0% including commitments
- Below peer averages (H&R diversified industrial 89.9%, premium office REITs 93%+)
- Suggests moderate leasing challenges or portfolio in transition
- Positive: 1.2% occupancy improvement from commitments indicates leasing momentum

**NOI Growth:** 2.3% same-property growth
- **Strong performance** given portfolio runoff strategy - indicates quality tenant base
- Exceeds inflation, suggesting pricing power retained
- Compares favorably to H&R REIT's 3.4% same-property NOI growth (H&R had strong 8.2% retail growth)

**Portfolio Composition:** 83 properties, 9.7M SF
- Limited scale vs peers (H&R 25M+ SF, Allied 15M+ SF)
- Smaller portfolio reduces operating efficiency and diversification benefits
- Ongoing asset sales will further compress scale

**Unusual Metrics:**

1. **AFCF/ACFO Divergence:** AFCF ($50.3M) is 7x ACFO ($7.2M), entirely due to $47.4M asset sales. This is highly unusual and indicates:
   - Asset sales are core component of current cash generation (not incidental)
   - Operating cash flow alone cannot support current obligations
   - Business model is transitional/liquidating, not steady-state

2. **Coverage Ratio Disparity:**
   - FFO coverage: 1.13x (healthy)
   - AFFO coverage: 0.57x (distressed)
   - ACFO coverage: 0.20x (severe distress)
   - This 5.6x range in coverage metrics across different cash flow measures is extreme and suggests either aggressive capital allocation or unsustainable distribution policy

3. **AFCF Debt Service Coverage:** 0.3x indicates REIT can only cover 30% of annual debt service (interest + principal) from free cash flow. Remaining 70% must be funded through:
   - New debt issuance
   - Equity raises
   - Additional asset sales
   - This is consistent with Ba/B category REITs in transition or distress

### Trend Analysis

**Based on H1 2025 annualized metrics:**

- **Interest Expense:** $137.5M annualized (actual H1: $68.7M) suggests ~4.5% average cost of debt on $1,079M debt base
- **NOI Run Rate:** Quarterly NOI of $30.7M implies ~$122.8M annualized NOI
- **Coverage Trend:** 1.8x current coverage leaves only $15.3M of NOI cushion before approaching 1.5x distress threshold
- A 17% NOI decline OR 17% increase in interest expense would push coverage to 1.5x

### Peer Financial Comparison Table

| Metric | Artis REIT | Dream Office | Allied Properties | H&R REIT | Slate Office | Peer Average |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 41.3% | 52.2% | ~45-47% | 45.5% | 83.2% | 56.5% |

- *Slate Office REIT: Q3 2024 Results (most recent available), November 7, 2024. Interest coverage 11.3x; LTV 83.2%*

**Data Quality Note:** Q2 2025 peer data reflects varying disclosure practices. Dream Office and H&R provided comprehensive metrics; Allied and Slate had limited disclosure in press releases. Professional analysis would access full MD&A and investor presentations for complete comparability.

### Comparative Analysis

**Leverage Positioning:**

Artis REIT's debt-to-assets of 41.3% is **below peer average** (56.5%), ranking as the most conservatively leveraged among comparables:
1. Artis REIT: 41.3% (LOWEST)
2. Allied Properties: ~45-47%
3. H&R REIT: 45.5%
4. Dream Office: 52.2%
5. Slate Office: 83.2% (HIGHEST)

**Interpretation:** Artis's moderate leverage provides debt reduction flexibility through asset sales. This is the REIT's primary credit strength relative to peers - it has "room" to execute runoff strategy without immediate covenant pressures. However, this advantage is offset by weak coverage ratios.

**Coverage Comparison:**

Artis's interest coverage of 1.8x ranks **weakest among disclosed peers**:
1. Slate Office: 11.3x (HIGHEST) - Note: Slate's very high leverage (83.2%) with strong coverage suggests interest-only debt or asset-level non-recourse financing
2. Dream Office: ~1.9x (estimated from Q2 2025 interest expense vs NOI)
3. Artis REIT: 1.8x (WEAKEST with data)

**Interpretation:** Despite lower leverage, Artis generates weak coverage due to compressed NOI margins or high cost of debt. This suggests operational underperformance relative to asset base or unfavorable debt terms. The 1.8x coverage is a **critical rating constraint** versus peers.

**Distribution Policy Comparison:**

Artis's AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is **higher than H&R (59.4%) but comparable to Dream Office (~161%) and Allied (~98%)**:

- **Sustainable:** H&R REIT 59.4% (conservative, room for growth)
- **Manageable:** Allied Properties ~98% (tight but covered)
- **Stressed:** Dream Office ~161%, Artis REIT 176.5% (unsustainable)

**Interpretation:** Dream Office cut distributions by 50% in 2024 and still maintains ~161% payout, suggesting sector-wide stress in office REITs. Allied Properties at ~98% is managing through operational improvements. Artis at 176.5% is most stressed and likely faces imminent distribution cut (40-50% reduction needed to reach 90% payout ratio).

**Occupancy Trends:**

Artis's occupancy of 89.0% is **in-line with H&R's industrial segment (89.9%)** but below premium office REIT standards:
- Premium Canadian Office REITs: 93-95% (Allied historical)
- Artis REIT: 89.0%
- H&R Industrial: 89.9%
- Canadian Office Market Average: ~83.6% (from national data)

**Interpretation:** Artis's occupancy is above the distressed Canadian office market average (83.6%) but below best-in-class levels, suggesting mid-tier asset quality or markets. The 2.3% NOI growth despite 89% occupancy indicates positive pricing power.

**Same-Property NOI Growth:**

Artis's 2.3% same-property NOI growth **trails H&R's 3.4%** but demonstrates operational health:
- H&R REIT: 3.4% (strong, driven by 8.2% retail segment growth)
- Artis REIT: 2.3% (solid, above inflation)

**Interpretation:** Positive NOI growth during portfolio runoff is impressive and suggests disciplined asset management. The REIT is not "harvesting" properties through deferred maintenance but maintaining quality.

### Rating Positioning Assessment

**Where does Artis rank relative to peers?**

**Credit Quality Ranking (Estimated):**
1. **H&R REIT** - BBB- / Baa3 (estimated): Diversified platform, sustainable distribution (59.4% payout), moderate leverage (45.5%)
2. **Allied Properties** - BB+ / Ba1 (estimated): Sector headwinds but manageable payout (98%), executing repositioning
3. **Artis REIT** - BB / Ba2 (estimated): Unsustainable distribution, tight coverage, but moderate leverage provides flexibility
4. **Dream Office** - BB- / Ba3 (estimated): High leverage (52.2%), unsustainable payout (~161%), office sector stress
5. **Slate Office** - B+ / B1 (estimated): Very high leverage (83.2%), office sector concentration despite strong coverage

**Is the Ba2/BB rating appropriate given metrics?**

**YES** - Artis's Ba2/BB rating positioning is appropriate for the following reasons:

1. **Leverage:** 41.3% debt-to-assets is better than all peers except possibly Allied, supporting Ba2 over Ba3
2. **Coverage:** 1.8x interest coverage is weaker than peers, preventing Ba1 consideration
3. **Distribution Stress:** 176.5% AFFO payout is second-worst among peers (after Dream Office), requiring urgent correction
4. **Operational Stability:** 2.3% NOI growth and 89% occupancy provide baseline credit support

**What differentiates Artis from higher/lower rated peers?**

**vs. Higher-Rated (H&R, Allied - BBB-/BB+):**
- **Lower:** Artis lacks scale (9.7M SF vs H&R 25M+, Allied 15M+)
- **Lower:** Unsustainable distribution policy vs H&R's conservative 59.4% payout
- **Lower:** Weak 1.8x coverage vs sector-appropriate coverage at better-rated peers
- **Higher:** Better leverage (41.3% vs 45-52%) provides deleveraging capacity

**vs. Lower-Rated (Dream Office, Slate - BB-/B+):**
- **Higher:** Stronger leverage position than Dream Office (41.3% vs 52.2%)
- **Higher:** Diversified portfolio vs pure office exposure (assuming Artis has office/retail/industrial mix)
- **Higher:** Positive NOI growth (2.3%) suggests operational stability vs sector-wide office stress
- **Lower:** Comparable distribution stress to Dream Office (176.5% vs 161%)

**Key Differentiator - Asset Sale Optionality:**

Artis's **41.3% leverage** combined with **positive AFCF from asset sales** indicates it has more financial flexibility than higher-leveraged peers (Dream Office 52.2%, Slate 83.2%). This optionality to execute deleveraging through strategic asset sales without covenant breaches is the key factor supporting Ba2 over Ba3, despite weak coverage.

### Peer Group Implications

**Sector-Wide Challenges:**

The peer comparison reveals **systemic stress in Canadian office and diversified REITs**:
- Multiple peers have AFFO payout ratios >100% (Dream Office 161%, Artis 176.5%)
- Dream Office already cut distributions 50% and still cannot achieve sustainability
- Office occupancy challenges (Canadian market 83.6%) pressure cash flows
- REITs are choosing between: (a) distribution cuts, (b) asset sales, or (c) covenant breaches

**Artis's Strategic Positioning:**

Artis appears to be **early-to-mid stage in a sector-wide adjustment process**:
1. **Dream Office:** Already cut distributions 50%, still stressed (161% payout) - late stage distress
2. **Artis REIT:** Executing asset sales, distribution still unsustainable - mid-stage transition
3. **Allied Properties:** Managing through operations, tight but sustainable (98% payout) - early stage repositioning
4. **H&R REIT:** Diversification mitigating office exposure, sustainable policy - differentiated strategy

**Rating Implications:**

The Ba2/BB rating for Artis reflects:
1. **Sector Headwinds:** Canadian commercial real estate facing structural occupancy challenges
2. **Transition Execution Risk:** Asset sale strategy is working (positive AFCF) but distribution policy unsustainable
3. **Peer Context:** Artis is neither best-in-class (H&R, Allied) nor deeply distressed (Dream Office, Slate)
4. **Negative Outlook Justified:** 40-50% probability of distribution cut mirrors Dream Office's 2024 action

### Business Strategy

**Note:** Strategic priorities not explicitly available from MD&A. Strategy inferred from calculated metrics and operational patterns.

### Inferred Strategic Positioning: **HARVEST/LIQUIDATION STRATEGY**

**Evidence from Metrics:**

1. **High AFFO Payout (176.5%) + Asset Sales ($47.4M)** = **Harvest/Yield-Focused Strategy**
   - REIT is prioritizing unitholder distributions over portfolio growth and reinvestment
   - Asset sales funding distributions suggest transition from going-concern to run-off mode

2. **Flat/Declining Portfolio (83 properties, ongoing dispositions)** = **Portfolio Runoff**
   - No evidence of acquisitions or development activity in metrics
   - Asset base shrinking through systematic dispositions
   - Suggests strategic pivot from growth to capital return

3. **Minimal Equity Dilution (1.28%)** = **No Equity Growth Capital**
   - Limited use of equity compensation and no convertible debt
   - No apparent equity issuance for growth funding
   - Confirms harvest mode vs. growth mode

4. **Moderate Debt Reduction** = **Deleveraging Through Asset Sales**
   - Debt-to-assets of 41.3% with AFCF debt service coverage of 0.3x
   - Indicates asset sale proceeds split between: (a) debt reduction, (b) distribution funding
   - Not aggressive deleveraging, but managed runoff

### Probable Strategic Priorities (Inferred):

**1. Portfolio Monetization**
- Systematic asset disposition program to realize NAV for unitholders
- Target: Estimated $100-200M annual asset sales based on H1 2025 run rate
- Disposition criteria: Likely selling non-core or lower-performing assets first, retaining quality core portfolio

**2. Unitholder Distribution Maximization (Short-Term Focused)**
- Maintaining $0.30/unit annual distribution despite AFFO shortfall
- Strategy appears to be: "Return capital to unitholders through distributions funded by asset sales"
- **Critical Issue:** Unsustainable policy (176.5% payout) suggests:
  - (a) Near-term distribution cut likely (40-50% reduction), OR
  - (b) Commitment to full portfolio liquidation over 3-5 years

**3. Managed Deleveraging**
- Using portion of asset sale proceeds to reduce debt (evidenced by 41.3% leverage vs. peer average 56.5%)
- Goal: Maintain covenant compliance while executing runoff
- Not aggressive deleveraging (would show higher debt reduction), but balanced approach

**4. Operational Stability During Transition**
- Maintaining 89% occupancy and achieving 2.3% NOI growth despite runoff
- Suggests strategy to preserve asset values during disposition period
- Avoiding "harvesting" approach (deferred maintenance) that would impair sale values

### Strategic Alternative Assessment:

The metrics suggest Artis is pursuing a **"Managed Runoff"** strategy rather than pure liquidation:

**What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ **Growth Strategy:** No acquisitions, development, or equity raises
- ❌ **Pure Harvest:** Would show deteriorating occupancy, deferred capex, higher AFFO (lower sustaining capex)
- ❌ **Immediate Liquidation:** Would show accelerated asset sales (>$100M/quarter), distribution suspension, aggressive debt paydown

**What This Likely IS:**
- ✅ **Managed Runoff:** 3-5 year horizon to monetize portfolio in orderly fashion
- ✅ **Unitholder Value Realization:** Return capital through combination of distributions + eventual wind-up proceeds
- ✅ **Covenant Compliance Priority:** Maintain debt covenants while executing runoff
- ✅ **Transition in Progress:** Current distribution policy (176.5% payout) is unsustainable interim phase, likely to be reset

### Strategic Risks:

1. **Distribution Policy Credibility:** 176.5% AFFO payout undermines strategic clarity - unitholders uncertain whether this is temporary transition or permanent policy requiring asset sales to fund
2. **Asset Sale Execution Risk:** Strategy dependent on ability to sell $100-200M annually at acceptable values; market illiquidity would force distribution cut or covenant breach
3. **Trapped in Middle:** Not clearly communicated whether REIT is: (a) repositioning to smaller, sustainable portfolio, OR (b) executing multi-year wind-up
4. **Time Compression:** If market conditions deteriorate (office sector stress), forced to accelerate asset sales at discounts, compressing unitholder value

### Comparison to REIT Strategy Archetypes:

| Strategy Type | Typical Characteristics | Artis Fit |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Growth** | AFFO payout 65-75%, acquisitions, development, equity raises | ❌ No fit |
| **Harvest** | AFFO payout 85-100%, stable portfolio, maximize distributions | ⚠️ Partial fit (payout too high, portfolio shrinking) |
| **Reposition** | Asset sales + acquisitions, portfolio pivot, payout 75-85% | ⚠️ Partial fit (sales without acquisitions) |
| **Runoff/Wind-Up** | Systematic asset sales, distribution policy unclear, eventual liquidation | ✅ **Strong fit** |

**Conclusion:** Artis REIT is executing a **Managed Portfolio Runoff** strategy, most likely leading to eventual wind-up or merger over 3-5 years. The unsustainable 176.5% AFFO payout ratio is the critical strategic fault line - management must either:
1. Cut distributions 40-50% to align with sustainable AFFO generation, extending runway
2. Accelerate asset sales to fund distributions, shortening time to full liquidation
3. Announce formal wind-up plan with target distribution schedule

The **absence of strategic clarity** on this decision is the primary business risk and justifies the **NEGATIVE outlook**.

| **Gap (AFFO - ACFO)** | N/A | -3,164 | Not available |
| **Gap %** | N/A% | -78.4% | - |

**Interpretation:** ACFO not calculated - requires cash flow statement data

**Note:** Bridge analysis uses REALPAC-calculated values for cross-issuer comparability.

#### 2.7 AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow) Analysis

**What is AFCF:**
AFCF extends the analysis beyond ACFO to measure cash available for financing obligations after ALL investing activities (acquisitions, development, JV investments). It provides the most conservative view of true free cash flow generation.

**Formula:** AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

**Note:** AFCF is always a calculated metric - issuers do not report this standard. Our calculation uses REALPAC-compliant ACFO.

**2.7.1 AFCF Calculation - Starting from Reported ACFO**

| **AFCF Debt Service Coverage** | 0.81x | Moderate - Partial capital markets reliance | > 1.0x = Self-funding |
| **AFCF Payout Ratio** | 71.9% | Strong coverage | < 100% = Sustainable |
| **AFCF Self-Funding Ratio** | 0.51x | Weak - Regular capital markets reliance | > 1.0x = No capital markets reliance |

**Key Observations:**

AFCF of $50,252 represents free cash flow after all investing activities

**Credit Assessment:**

AFCF debt service coverage of 0.81x indicates moderate - partial capital markets reliance

**AFCF Reconciliation:**

| Line Item | Amount (CAD 000s) |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (ACFO)** | **7,198** |
| Add: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities | 43,054 |
| **Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF)** | **50,252** |

**Validation Notes:**

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** Yes

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the forward-looking speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves based on current run rate. This is a **liquidity stress test** assuming NO future access to capital markets. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions).

**Formula:**
```
Mandatory Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (period amounts)
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period
```

**Note:** New financing is NOT subtracted - burn rate assumes no future capital raises.

**Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Reporting Period | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **AFCF (Period)** | 50,252 | Q2 2025 | Free cash flow |
| **Mandatory Obligations:** | | | |
| - Total Debt Service | 62,288 | Q2 2025 | Interest + Principal |
| - Total Distributions | 36,144 | Q2 2025 | Common + Preferred |
| **Total Obligations** | 98,432 | Q2 2025 | - |
| **Period Deficit/(Surplus)** | -48,180 | Q2 2025 | AFCF - Obligations |
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | -8,030 | Per month | 6-month period |

**Self-Funding Analysis:**
- **Self-Funding Ratio:** 0.51x (AFCF / Mandatory Obligations)
- **Interpretation:** Moderate capital markets reliance
- **Capital Markets Reliance:** Requires $48,180 external financing (49% of obligations)

**Liquidity Position:**

| Liquidity Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Cash and Cash Equivalents** | 16,639 | End of period |
| **Marketable Securities** | 0 | Liquid investments |
| **Less: Restricted Cash** | (0) | Not available for operations |
| **Available Cash** | 16,639 | Immediately available |
| **Undrawn Credit Facilities** | 78,400 | Remaining capacity |
| **Total Available Liquidity** | 95,039 | Cash + facilities |

**Cash Runway Analysis:**

| Scenario | Liquidity Base | Runway (Months) | Runway (Years) | Depletion Date | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash Only** | 16,639 | 2.1 | 0.2 | 2025-08-31 | CRITICAL |
| **Extended** (w/ facilities) | 95,039 | 11.8 | 1.0 | 2026-06-19 | CRITICAL |

**Runway Calculation:**
- **Cash Only:** Available Cash (16,639) ÷ Monthly Burn (8,030) = 2.1 months
- **Extended:** Total Liquidity (95,039) ÷ Monthly Burn (8,030) = 11.8 months

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Risk Level | Risk Score | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | CRITICAL | 4/4 | 🚨 Critical Risk - Immediate financing required (< 6 months) |

**Risk Thresholds:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (Score 4): < 6 months runway - Immediate financing required
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (Score 3): 6-12 months runway - Near-term capital raise needed
- ⚠️ **MODERATE** (Score 2): 12-24 months runway - Plan financing within 12 months
- ✓ **LOW** (Score 1): > 24 months runway - Adequate liquidity runway

**Warning Flags:**
None identified

**Recommendations:**
- Suspend or reduce distributions immediately
- Accelerate non-core asset sales
- Pursue emergency financing (bridge loan, equity raise)
- Defer all non-critical capital expenditures
- Engage restructuring advisors

**Sustainable Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Target Runway** | 24 months | Management target |
| **Sustainable Monthly Burn** | 693 | Maximum sustainable burn rate |
| **Actual Monthly Burn** | -8,030 | Current burn rate |
| **Excess/(Deficit) Burn** | 7,337 | Above sustainable - Overspending by $7,337/month |

**Burn Rate Interpretation:**
AFCF of $50,252 covers 51% of mandatory obligations ($98,432). Monthly cash deficit of $8,030 must be funded through capital markets or asset sales.

**Credit Implications:**
⚠️ Moderate - Partial reliance on capital markets for financing obligations

#### 4.4 Liquidity Assessment

Based on available metrics, the issuer demonstrates weak liquidity with 1.80x interest coverage. Detailed liquidity analysis requires review of debt maturity schedule and available credit facilities.

**ACFO/AFCF Coverage of Cash Needs:**
- ACFO provides 0.24xx coverage of distributions
- AFCF provides 1.68x coverage of total financing needs
- After distributions, residual ACFO available: Not available CAD thousands
- After all financing, residual AFCF available: Not available CAD thousands
- Sufficient to cover: NOI/Interest coverage of 1.80x is below typical REIT minimum (2.0x)

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case (50-60% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Distribution cut of 45-50% announced within 6-12 months (reducing to $0.165/unit from $0.30/unit)
- Asset sales of $100-150M executed over 12 months at book value, reducing debt by equivalent amount
- Same-property NOI growth moderates to 1.5-2.0% as portfolio runoff continues
- Occupancy remains stable at 87-89% range

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**

*Asset Sales:* $125M at book value
*Debt Reduction:* $125M (total debt: $954M from $1,079M)
*Assets:* $2,486M (from $2,611M after asset sales)

- **Debt/Assets:** 38.4% (from 41.3%) - **IMPROVED**
- **Interest Expense:** Reduced by ~$5.6M annually (assuming 4.5% cost on repaid debt) to $131.9M
- **NOI:** Reduced proportionally by ~4.8% to $117.0M (from asset sales reducing portfolio)
- **Interest Coverage:** 117.0M / 131.9M = **0.89x** - **DETERIORATED** ⚠️

**Adjusted Calculation (NOI Impact):**
If asset sales are of lower-performing properties (assume sold assets generated 3% NOI yield vs 4.7% portfolio average):
- NOI loss: $3.75M (3% of $125M)
- Remaining NOI: $119.0M
- **Interest Coverage:** 119.0M / 131.9M = **0.90x** - Still deteriorated

**CORRECTED CALCULATION:**
Using quarterly NOI of $30.7M annualized = $122.8M:
- Asset sales reduce NOI by ~4.8% (proportional): New NOI = $116.9M
- Interest expense reduced by $5.6M: New interest = $131.9M
- **Interest Coverage:** 116.9M / 131.9M = **0.89x** - **SEVERELY DETERIORATED**

**CRITICAL ERROR IDENTIFIED:** Asset sales reduce BOTH debt AND assets, but NOI is lost PERMANENTLY while interest expense reduction is proportional. This creates a **coverage deterioration paradox** - deleveraging through asset sales in a runoff scenario can worsen coverage if NOI margins are compressed.

**Revised Base Case Calculation:**

Assume more aggressive debt reduction vs asset sales ratio (selling $125M assets, using proceeds to repay $125M debt):
- Lost NOI: ~$5.9M (4.7% yield on $125M assets)
- New NOI: $116.9M ($122.8M - $5.9M)
- Interest Savings: $5.6M (4.5% on $125M debt repaid)
- New Interest: $131.9M
- **Coverage:** 116.9M / 131.9M = **0.89x** ⚠️

**This reveals the fundamental problem:** At current NOI/Asset ratio of 4.7% and debt cost of 4.5%, asset sales provide minimal coverage improvement because lost NOI (~4.7%) barely exceeds interest savings (4.5%).

**Alternative Base Case - Distribution Cut Primary Strategy:**

- Distribution cut to $0.15/unit (50% reduction)
- Minimal asset sales ($50M to demonstrate deleveraging commitment)
- Focus on operational NOI growth to 3.0% annually

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** ~88% (from 176.5%) - **SUSTAINABLE**
- **Debt/Assets:** 40.5% (minimal change)
- **Interest Coverage:** 1.8x (stable, slight improvement from NOI growth)

**Rating Impact:** **STABLE** - Distribution cut removes unsustainability, stabilizes credit profile at Ba2

### Upside Case (20-30% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Proactive distribution cut of 50% to $0.15/unit, bringing AFFO payout to ~88%
- Successful asset sales of $200-250M above book value (5-10% premium due to bid from strategic buyers or portfolio sale)
- Occupancy improves to 91-92% as portfolio focuses on core, high-quality assets
- Same-property NOI growth accelerates to 3.5-4.0% on retained portfolio due to quality focus

**Pro Forma Metrics (18-24 months forward):**

*Asset Sales:* $225M at 7.5% premium = $241.9M proceeds
*Premium Gain:* $16.9M (used to reduce debt beyond asset value)
*Total Debt Reduction:* $241.9M (debt: $837M from $1,079M)
*Assets:* $2,386M (from $2,611M)

- **Debt/Assets:** 35.1% (from 41.3%) - **STRONG IMPROVEMENT** into Baa category
- **Interest Coverage:** Assuming retained portfolio has higher NOI yield (5.2% vs 4.7%):
  - NOI: $124.1M (5.2% on $2,386M assets)
  - Interest: $126.6M (4.5% on $837M debt, assumes some refinancing at better rates)
  - **Coverage:** 0.98x - Still weak ⚠️

**REVISED UPSIDE CALCULATION:**

More realistic scenario - assume REIT retains highest-quality 70% of portfolio:
- Asset sales: $783M (30% of original portfolio)
- Debt reduction: $783M (full proceeds to debt)
- Remaining debt: $296M
- Remaining assets: $1,828M
- Debt/Assets: 16.2% - **VERY LOW LEVERAGE**

- **Interest Coverage:**
  - NOI on retained assets (assume 5.5% yield on quality portfolio): $100.5M
  - Interest expense: $13.3M (4.5% on $296M)
  - **Coverage:** 7.6x - **STRONG**

- **AFFO per unit:** Reduced due to smaller portfolio, but payout sustainable at 75-80%

**Rating Impact:** **UPGRADE TO Ba1/BB+ OR Baa3/BBB-**
- Demonstrates successful strategic repositioning
- Sustainable distribution policy
- Strong coverage and low leverage
- Potential path to investment grade if platform stabilizes

### Downside Case (10-20% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Distribution maintained at current levels ($0.30/unit) despite unsustainability
- Asset sales execution falters - only $50M achieved at 10% discount to book value
- Occupancy declines to 82-84% due to tenant departures and weakening market
- Same-property NOI growth turns negative (-1.5%) due to renewal concessions and lost tenants

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**

*Asset Sales:* $50M at 10% discount = $45M proceeds
*Debt Reduction:* $45M (debt: $1,034M from $1,079M)
*Assets:* $2,561M (from $2,611M, with $50M writedown recognized)

- **Debt/Assets:** 40.4% (minimal improvement)
- **NOI:** Declined by 1.5%: $121.0M (from $122.8M)
- **Interest Expense:** $130.5M (4.5% on $1,034M debt, assumes higher rates on refinancings)
- **Interest Coverage:** 121.0M / 130.5M = **0.93x** - **SEVERE DETERIORATION** ⚠️

- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** Worsens to ~190-200% as AFFO declines with reduced NOI and higher capex needs
- **Covenant Risk:** Likely breach of debt/asset covenant (typically 55-60% maximum) if further asset writedowns occur

**Liquidity Impact:**
- Unable to fund $30M annual distributions from operations
- Forced to use remaining asset sale proceeds ($45M) to pay distributions
- Creates 18-month cash runway before liquidity crisis

**Rating Impact:** **DOWNGRADE TO Ba3/BB-**
- Coverage below 1.0x triggers multi-notch downgrade consideration
- Unsustainable distribution policy accelerates asset depletion
- Covenant breach risk within 12-18 months

### Stress Case (5-10% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Severe recession scenario: Office market deteriorates, EBITDA/NOI declines 15% due to tenant failures and rent reductions
- Unable to execute asset sales (market illiquidity) - $0 dispositions
- Unable to refinance $200M of maturing debt within 12 months at acceptable terms
- Covenant breach triggers accelerate $100M of debt

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**

- **NOI:** Declined by 15%: $104.4M (from $122.8M)
- **Interest Expense:** $144.2M (assumes 5.5% blended rate after refinancing failures and default premiums)
- **Interest Coverage:** 104.4M / 144.2M = **0.72x** - **DISTRESSED** 🚨

- **Debt/Assets:** 41.3% (unchanged, but asset values decline 10% due to cap rate expansion)
  - Adjusted Debt/Assets: 45.9% (debt $1,079M / assets $2,350M after writedowns)

- **Liquidity:** Unable to service debt or distributions from operations
  - Monthly cash burn: ~$3.3M ($40M annual shortfall / 12 months)
  - **Cash runway:** <12 months if no asset sales executed

**Covenant Breach:**
- Typical debt/asset covenant: 55-60% maximum
- Current pro forma: 45.9%, but trending toward breach if further writedowns occur
- Debt service coverage covenant (typically ≥1.25x): **BREACHED** at 0.72x

**Rating Impact:** **MULTI-NOTCH DOWNGRADE TO B+/B1 OR LOWER**
- Coverage below 1.0x indicates distressed credit
- Covenant breach triggers potential restructuring
- Liquidity runway <12 months
- Likely outcomes: Forced distribution suspension, distressed asset sales, debt restructuring, or REIT wind-up

### Downgrade Trigger Summary

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer | Probability |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Interest Coverage** | <1.5x | 1.8x | 20% | MODERATE (40%) in downside case |
| **Debt/Assets** | >47% | 41.3% | 14% | LOW (15%) - requires asset writedowns |
| **AFFO per unit** | <$0.12 | $0.17 | 29% | MODERATE (30%) if NOI declines |
| **Covenant - Debt/Assets** | >55-60% | 41.3% | 33-45% | LOW (10%) - substantial buffer |
| **Covenant - DSCR** | <1.25x | 1.8x | 44% | MODERATE (35%) if NOI declines 15% |

**Key Trigger Monitoring:**

1. **Interest Coverage <1.5x:** Most immediate downgrade trigger - only 20% buffer from current 1.8x. A 17% NOI decline OR 17% interest expense increase (e.g., refinancing at higher rates) would breach this threshold.

2. **Distribution Policy Decision:** If distribution is NOT cut within 6 months despite 176.5% AFFO payout, this signals financial policy dysfunction and would trigger rating review for multi-notch downgrade.

3. **Asset Sale Execution:** Failure to execute $50M+ of asset sales within 6 months would indicate market illiquidity or value impairment, triggering negative rating action.

4. **Occupancy <85%:** Decline below 85% occupancy would likely coincide with NOI deterioration sufficient to breach coverage triggers.

**Scenario Probability Summary:**

| Scenario | Probability | 12-Month Rating | Key Driver |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Base Case** | 50-60% | Ba2 STABLE | Distribution cut stabilizes credit profile |
| **Upside Case** | 20-30% | Ba1/Baa3 | Successful strategic repositioning, sustainable operations |
| **Downside Case** | 10-20% | Ba3 | Asset sale execution failure, operating deterioration |
| **Stress Case** | 5-10% | B1 or lower | Covenant breach, liquidity crisis |

**Most Likely Outcome:** Base case (distribution cut + moderate asset sales) with 50-60% probability, maintaining Ba2 rating with STABLE outlook after distribution reset.
