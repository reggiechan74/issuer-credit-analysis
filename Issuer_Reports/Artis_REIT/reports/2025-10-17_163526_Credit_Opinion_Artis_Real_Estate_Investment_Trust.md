## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust is a diversified Canadian commercial REIT with $2.6 billion in gross assets as of Q2 2025. The REIT faces material credit challenges characterized by moderate leverage (41.3% Debt/Assets), weak interest coverage (1.81x NOI/Interest), and an unsustainable distribution policy (187.5% AFFO payout ratio). The credit profile reflects a REIT in active portfolio repositioning mode, monetizing non-core assets to reduce debt while maintaining unit buybacks through its NCIB program. The combination of aggressive financial policy, elevated refinancing risk, and compressed coverage metrics supports a Ba category rating.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. Moderate leverage at upper end of investment grade range (41.3% Debt/Assets)
2. Weak coverage with limited buffer to covenant thresholds (1.81x NOI/Interest)
3. Unsustainable distribution policy consuming 187.5% of AFFO
4. Active deleveraging strategy through asset sales ($4.8M sold in Q2 2025)

---

## Credit Strengths

**1. Diversified Asset Base Across Property Types and Geographies**
- Portfolio of 83 properties totaling 9.67 million square feet
- Diversification across industrial, office, and retail asset classes reduces single-sector concentration risk
- Geographic presence in both Canadian and U.S. markets provides market diversification

**2. Consistent Operational Performance with Positive Leasing Momentum**
- 18 consecutive quarters of weighted-average rental rate growth on renewals
- Q2 2025 renewal spreads of +3.6% demonstrate pricing power
- Same Property NOI growth of 2.3% (6M 2025) indicates stable operating fundamentals
- Occupancy including commitments of 89.0% is reasonable for diversified REIT

**3. Active Deleveraging Strategy with Asset Sale Program**
- Ongoing monetization of non-core assets with Q2 2025 retail property sale at $4.8M
- Management commitment to "selling assets at or above IFRS values" supports balance sheet protection
- Disposition strategy focused on tax-efficient value realization

**4. Public Market Access with TSX and OTCQX Listings**
- Common units trade on TSX (AX.UN) and OTCQX (ARESF)
- Two series of preferred units listed (AX.PR.E, AX.PR.I)
- Public market presence provides capital markets access for refinancing needs

**5. Established Operating Track Record**
- REIT structure in place since 2004 (Declaration of Trust dated November 8, 2004)
- Governed under Manitoba law as unincorporated closed-end REIT
- Mature platform with established governance framework

---

---

## Credit Challenges

**1. Critically Weak Interest Coverage with Limited Margin for Error**
- NOI/Interest coverage of 1.81x is well below investment grade standards (typically 2.5x+ for Baa)
- Coverage sits firmly in Ba territory (2.0-3.0x range per Moody's methodology)
- Quarterly interest expense of $16.9M (annualized $67.7M) consumes 55% of NOI
- Minimal buffer to potential covenant violations if operating performance deteriorates

**2. Unsustainable Distribution Policy Eroding Financial Flexibility**
- AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% means distributions exceed sustainable cash flow by 87.5 percentage points
- FFO payout ratio of 88.2% appears manageable but masks underlying AFFO strain
- Distributions per unit of $0.15/quarter against AFFO of $0.08/unit requires external funding
- Policy limits capacity to retain cash for debt reduction or future investment

**3. Elevated Leverage at Upper End of Investment Grade Range**
- Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3% sits at boundary between Baa (35-45%) and Ba (45-55%) categories
- Net Debt of $1.06 billion represents 40.7% of assets
- Total Debt of $1.08 billion creates refinancing risk given coverage constraints
- Leverage position vulnerable to asset value declines or NOI compression

**4. Limited Scale Compared to Investment Grade REIT Peers**
- Gross assets of $2.61 billion place Artis in Ba category for scale (<$5B per Moody's framework)
- Smaller size limits economies of scale and capital markets access relative to larger REITs
- Market capitalization constraints may impact cost of capital and refinancing flexibility

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

**NEGATIVE**

The Negative outlook reflects material uncertainty regarding Artis REIT's ability to achieve meaningful deleveraging while maintaining its current distribution policy. The REIT faces a challenging path forward characterized by three competing priorities: (1) asset monetization to reduce debt, (2) maintenance of 187.5% AFFO payout distributions, and (3) continuation of unit buybacks through the NCIB program. The combination of weak coverage (1.81x), elevated AFFO payout (187.5%), and moderate leverage (41.3%) creates downgrade risk if:

- Asset sales fail to materialize at or above book value
- Operating performance deteriorates (occupancy declines, negative renewal spreads)
- Interest rates remain elevated at refinancing, further compressing coverage
- Distribution policy is maintained without AFFO improvement

**Stabilization Factors (12-18 months):**
The outlook could return to Stable if Artis demonstrates:
- Debt reduction of $100-150M through asset sales at book value or better
- Coverage improvement to 2.0x+ through NOI growth or debt paydown
- AFFO payout ratio reduction to 120-130% range through distribution cut or AFFO growth
- Maintenance of occupancy at 87-90% with continued positive renewal spreads

**Probability Assessment:**
- **Base Case (50%):** Moderate asset sales ($50-100M), coverage remains 1.7-1.9x, rating stable at Ba2
- **Upside (20%):** Successful asset program ($150-200M), coverage improves to 2.0x+, potential upgrade to Ba1
- **Downside (30%):** Limited asset sales, coverage deteriorates below 1.6x, downgrade to Ba3

**Stabilization Criteria:** Not specified

---

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

**Quantitative Thresholds (12-24 month horizon):**

| Metric | Current | Upgrade Trigger | Path to Achievement |
|--------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **NOI Interest Coverage** | 1.81x | >2.25x | Debt reduction $200M+ or NOI growth 15-20% |
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | 41.3% | <38% | Asset sales $150-200M with debt paydown |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 187.5% | <100% | Distribution cut to $0.08-0.09/unit or AFFO growth 50%+ |
| **Net Debt** | $1.06B | <$900M | Asset sales $200M with full debt repayment |
| **Gross Assets** | $2.61B | >$3.0B | Growth strategy (incompatible with deleveraging) |

**Operational Improvements Required:**
1. **Portfolio Quality Enhancement:** Focus asset sales on lower-quality secondary market properties while retaining trophy assets
2. **Occupancy Expansion:** Achieve sustained occupancy of 92-95% including commitments
3. **NOI Margin Expansion:** Increase NOI margin through expense management and rent growth acceleration
4. **Lease Duration Extension:** Improve weighted-average lease term to reduce rollover risk

**Strategic Actions Supporting Upgrade:**
- **Distribution Policy Reset:** Reduce quarterly distribution from $0.15 to $0.08-0.10 per unit (in line with AFFO generation)
- **Accelerated Asset Sales:** Execute $200-300M of dispositions over 18-24 months at book value or premium
- **Debt Repayment Priority:** Direct 100% of asset sale proceeds to debt reduction (suspend unit buybacks temporarily)
- **Coverage-Focused Refinancing:** Opportunistically refinance maturing debt at lower rates to improve coverage

**Upgrade Scenario Probability:** 15-20% over 24 months (requires difficult distribution cut decision)

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

**Quantitative Trigger Points:**

| Trigger | Current | Downgrade Threshold | Scenario |
|---------|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **NOI Interest Coverage** | 1.81x | <1.60x | NOI decline 12% or interest expense increase 13% |
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | 41.3% | >47% | Asset value decline 10% or debt increase $150M |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 187.5% | >225% | AFFO decline 15% with distribution maintained |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 87.8% | <82% | Major tenant defaults or market deterioration |
| **Same Property NOI Growth** | 2.3% | Negative | Market recession or significant renewal spread compression |

**Downgrade Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Asset Sale Program Failure (30% probability)**
- Unable to monetize assets at book value; forced to accept 10-15% discounts
- Gross assets decline to $2.3B but debt remains at $1.05B
- Debt/Assets ratio increases to 45.6%, approaching Ba/B boundary
- **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to Ba3

**Scenario 2: Operational Deterioration (20% probability)**
- Major tenant bankruptcy (e.g., 200,000 SF anchor tenant default)
- Occupancy declines to 82-84%; NOI falls 10-12%
- Coverage compresses to 1.6x or below
- **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to Ba3, potential further pressure to B1

**Scenario 3: Refinancing Stress (15% probability)**
- $200M+ of debt matures at rates 150-200bps higher than current
- Annualized interest expense increases from $67.7M to $75M+
- Coverage deteriorates to 1.55-1.65x
- **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to Ba3

**Scenario 4: Distribution Policy Maintained Despite Deterioration (25% probability)**
- AFFO declines 10-15% due to occupancy or margin compression
- Management maintains $0.15/quarter distribution
- AFFO payout ratio increases to 210-225%
- External financing required to fund distributions
- **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to Ba3, potentially B1 if debt increases materially

**Covenant Breach Risk:**
Typical REIT debt covenants include:
- Debt/Gross Book Value <60-65%
- Interest Coverage >1.50x
- Unencumbered Asset Pool minimums

With coverage at 1.81x, Artis has approximately 20% buffer to potential 1.50x covenant. A single-quarter NOI decline of 17% would approach covenant territory, highlighting limited margin for error.

**Cumulative Downgrade Probability:** 30-35% over 12 months absent distribution policy change

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

### Moody's-Style Scorecard for Artis REIT

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Ba | Ba2 | Gross assets of $2.61B place Artis in $2-5B range (Ba category per Moody's). Significantly below $5B threshold for Baa rating. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Ba | Ba2 | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Mixed portfolio across office, industrial, retail. Secondary markets with 87.8% occupancy. Some quality concerns given weak coverage. **Ba2 sub-score**. **Market Position (12.5%):** Diversified REIT with no dominant market position. Faces competitive pressure in all segments. Modest scale limits market influence. **Ba2 sub-score**. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Ba | Ba2 | Public market access via TSX and OTCQX provides refinancing options, but weak coverage (1.81x) and unsustainable payout (187.5% AFFO) constrain capital market receptiveness. Likely faces higher borrowing costs than investment grade REITs. Recent asset sale of $4.8M demonstrates ability to execute dispositions but limited volume to date. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Ba | Ba2 | **Debt/Gross Assets:** 41.32% sits at upper end of Baa range (35-45%) but below Ba midpoint. **Ba1/Ba2 indicator**. **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 1.81x firmly in Ba range (2.0-3.0x per Moody's), well below Baa minimum of 3.0x. Weak coverage is primary rating constraint. **Ba2/Ba3 indicator**. Weighted assessment: **Ba2** given coverage weakness offsets moderate leverage. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | B | B1 | **Highly Aggressive:** AFFO payout of 187.5% is unsustainable and characteristic of financial stress. Distributions consume nearly 2x AFFO generation, requiring asset sales or external financing. Continued unit buybacks via NCIB despite weak coverage demonstrates priority for unitholder returns over balance sheet strength. Financial policy is incompatible with investment grade and pressures rating even within Ba category. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Ba** | **Ba2** | **Indicated Rating: Ba2 (Moody's) / Ba (S&P equivalent)** |

**Scorecard Methodology Notes:**
- Factor weights reflect Moody's REIT methodology (January 2023)
- Leverage & Coverage is highest-weighted factor (35%), reflecting centrality to REIT credit quality
- Financial Policy receives lower weight (15%) but has disproportionate impact given severity of AFFO payout issue
- Scale factor (5%) is least influential; Artis would require growth to $5B+ to improve this score

**Adjustments to Scorecard Outcome:**
- **No adjustments applied:** Ba2 scorecard outcome is appropriate given balanced assessment across factors
- Financial Policy weakness (B1 sub-score) is adequately captured within overall Ba2 rating
- Negative outlook reflects near-term downside risks from unsustainable distribution policy

**Rating Confidence Level:** Moderate-High. Scorecard-indicated Ba2 is well-supported by quantitative metrics and credit methodology. Rating could move to Ba3 if coverage deteriorates below 1.6x or AFFO payout exceeds 200%.

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**FFO and AFFO Quality:**
- Q2 2025 FFO of $16.96M ($0.17/unit) represents core operating cash generation
- AFFO of $8.20M ($0.08/unit) adjusts for maintenance capex and straight-line rent
- 52% spread between FFO and AFFO ($8.76M quarterly difference) indicates material capital reinvestment requirements
- AFFO per unit of $0.08 is less than half the $0.15 quarterly distribution, highlighting fundamental policy mismatch

**Distribution Policy Sustainability:**
- FFO payout ratio of 88.2% appears within normal REIT range (80-95% typical)
- However, AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% reveals true unsustainability
- AFFO is the more appropriate sustainability metric as it accounts for maintenance capital
- Current policy requires $7M per quarter ($28M annually) of external funding to bridge distribution shortfall
- Likely funded through asset sales, which is not repeatable indefinitely

**Portfolio Quality and Occupancy:**
- Occupancy of 87.8% (in-place) / 89.0% (including commitments) is below optimal 92-95% range
- 120bps gap between in-place and committed occupancy indicates near-term leasing pipeline
- 18 consecutive quarters of positive renewal spreads (+3.6% in Q2) demonstrates landlord pricing power
- Same Property NOI growth of 2.3% is modest but positive, reflecting market stability

**Unusual Ratios and Trends:**
1. **AFFO Payout Disconnect:** 187.5% payout is extreme outlier versus typical 80-95% REIT range
2. **FFO vs AFFO Gap:** 52% differential (FFO of $0.17 vs AFFO of $0.08 per unit) suggests high capex intensity
3. **Interest Burden:** Interest expense of $16.9M consumes 55% of NOI, leaving minimal cushion for distribution and reinvestment
4. **Asset Sale Velocity:** Only $4.8M sold in Q2 2025; pace appears insufficient to materially delever within 12-18 months

**Operating Efficiency:**
- NOI of $30.7M on 9.67M SF implies $3.17/SF quarterly NOI ($12.68/SF annualized)
- This is reasonable for diversified REIT but not premium (trophy properties achieve $20-30/SF)
- Moderate NOI/SF suggests mix of quality assets rather than uniformly high-grade portfolio

**Leverage Progression:**
- Net Debt of $1.06B vs Gross Assets of $2.61B implies 40.7% net leverage
- 65bps difference between gross (41.3%) and net (40.7%) leverage indicates modest cash position ($16.6M)
- Limited cash balance provides minimal liquidity buffer for debt maturities or operational stress

**Coverage Deterioration Risk:**
- Annualized interest expense of $67.7M on debt of $1.08B implies weighted-average rate of 6.27%
- If rates increase 100bps at refinancing, interest expense would increase to $78.5M, compressing coverage to 1.56x
- This would approach typical REIT covenant threshold of 1.50x, creating potential breach risk

### Peer Analysis and Artis Positioning

**Leverage Comparison:**
- Artis debt/assets of 41.3% is **second-lowest among peers** (after H&R GAAP basis at 34.9%)
- However, H&R proportionate share leverage of 45.5% suggests Artis is in-line with sector median
- Dream Office at 52.2% debt/assets carries materially higher leverage, indicating office sector stress
- Allied Properties at 44% and actively targeting debt reduction to net debt/EBITDA <10x by year-end
- **Conclusion:** Artis leverage is not an outlier; positioned at peer median of ~43%

**Coverage and Distribution Sustainability:**
- Artis NOI interest coverage of 1.81x is **critically weak** relative to implied peer range of 1.9-2.5x
- Allied Properties AFFO payout of 99% vs Artis 187.5% highlights Artis as **severe outlier**
- Choice Properties FFO payout of 72.6% represents investment grade discipline vs Artis 88.2%
- **Conclusion:** Artis distribution policy is unsustainable relative to peers; Allied at 99% AFFO payout is closest comp but still 88 percentage points better than Artis

**Operational Performance:**
- Artis occupancy of 87.8-89.0% is **below peer median** of ~91%
- Dream Office and Allied both report 87% occupancy range, reflecting office sector challenges
- H&R (95.6% overall) and Choice Properties (98.6% retail) benefit from retail/industrial mix
- Artis Same Property NOI growth of 2.3% is **below peer median** of 3.4%
- H&R (3.4%) and Choice Properties (4.8%) demonstrate stronger operating momentum
- **Conclusion:** Artis operational performance is lagging higher-quality peers; in-line with stressed office REITs

**Scale and Market Position:**
- Artis gross assets of $2.6B are **smallest among peers** except Dream Office ($2.3B)
- Allied ($10.9B) and Choice Properties ($16B+) have 4-6x scale advantage
- Limited scale constrains Artis capital markets access and cost of capital
- **Conclusion:** Artis is subscale relative to investment grade REITs; positioned with smaller, stressed peers

**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Dream Office:** Fellow office-exposed REIT in deleveraging mode; faces similar structural challenges
- **Allied Properties:** Actively restructuring with $200M+ asset sale targets; comparable to Artis strategy
- **H&R:** Diversified model with stronger operational performance; represents "upgrade target" for Artis
- **Choice Properties:** Investment grade REIT with conservative financial policy; aspirational benchmark

### Rating Positioning Relative to Peers

**Estimated Peer Ratings (indicative):**
- **Dream Office REIT:** Ba3/B1 (52.2% leverage, office sector stress, weak coverage implied)
- **Allied Properties REIT:** Ba2 (44% leverage, 99% AFFO payout, targeting deleveraging)
- **H&R REIT:** Ba1/Baa3 (34.9-45.5% leverage range, diversified, stronger operations)
- **Choice Properties REIT:** Baa2/BBB (investment grade, 72.6% FFO payout, 98.6% occupancy, Loblaw backing)

**Artis Rating Positioning: Ba2 (as assessed)**

**Comparative Analysis:**
- Artis **Ba2 rating aligns with Allied Properties** given similar leverage (41% vs 44%) and both in active deleveraging
- Artis positioned **better than Dream Office** due to diversification (office-only exposure at Dream is higher risk)
- Artis positioned **weaker than H&R** due to inferior operational metrics (87.8% vs 95.6% occupancy; 2.3% vs 3.4% NOI growth)
- Artis positioned **two notches below Choice Properties** (Ba2 vs Baa2) primarily due to unsustainable distribution policy and weak coverage

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Artis distribution policy (187.5% AFFO payout) is worst among peers** - this is primary rating constraint
2. **Artis coverage (1.81x) is weakest among peers** where data available
3. **Artis occupancy (87.8%) and NOI growth (2.3%) lag higher-quality peers**
4. **Artis leverage (41.3%) is in-line with peers** and not a differentiating factor

**Rating Implications:**
- If Artis reduced distribution to sustainable level (AFFO payout 90-100%), rating could improve to **Ba1**
- If coverage improved to 2.0x+ through debt reduction, rating could reach **Ba1/Baa3 boundary**
- Without policy changes, current **Ba2 rating is appropriate** given peer positioning
- Downside risk to **Ba3** exists if asset sale program fails or operations deteriorate

**Conclusion:**
Artis REIT's Ba2 rating is well-calibrated within the peer group. The REIT sits firmly in the middle of non-investment grade Canadian commercial REITs, positioned between severely stressed office peers (Dream Office at Ba3) and higher-quality diversified REITs approaching investment grade (H&R at Ba1). The unsustainable distribution policy is the primary factor preventing a higher rating, as leverage and asset quality metrics are in-line with peers.

## Profile

**Issuer:** Artis Real Estate Investment Trust

**Reporting Date:** 2025-06-30

**Report Period:** Q2 2025

### Company Background

### Corporate Structure and History

**Legal Structure:**
Artis Real Estate Investment Trust is an **unincorporated closed-end real estate investment trust** created under and governed by the laws of the Province of Manitoba. The REIT was established pursuant to the Declaration of Trust dated **November 8, 2004**, as most recently amended and restated on December 19, 2021.

**Exchange Listings:**
- **Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX):**
  - Common units: AX.UN
  - Preferred units, Series E: AX.PR.E
  - Preferred units, Series I: AX.PR.I
- **OTCQX Best Market (U.S.):**
  - Common units: ARESF

**Outstanding Securities (as of August 7, 2025):**
- Common units: 96,617,287
- Preferred units: 7,150,565
- Restricted units: 721,165
- Deferred units: 551,472

**Market Capitalization (indicative):**
With 96.6 million common units outstanding, at an estimated unit price of $8-10 CAD (typical for REITs of this profile), implied market capitalization is approximately $773M-$966M CAD. This represents a significant discount to book value given gross assets of $2.6 billion less debt of $1.1 billion implies equity book value of ~$1.5 billion. The discount reflects market skepticism regarding asset valuations and distribution sustainability.

### Geographic Footprint and Property Portfolio

**Portfolio Composition (Q2 2025):**
- Total properties: 83
- Total gross leasable area: 9,673,000 square feet
- Asset classes: Industrial, Office, Retail
- Geographic markets: Canada and United States

**Strategic Focus:**
Artis is positioned as a **diversified commercial REIT** with exposure across multiple property types and markets. The diversification provides risk mitigation against single-sector downturns but limits ability to develop deep market expertise or dominant market positions in any single segment.

**Portfolio Quality:**
- Occupancy of 87.8% (in-place) / 89.0% (including commitments) suggests moderate-quality assets
- 18 consecutive quarters of positive renewal spreads (+3.6% in Q2) indicates assets in markets with pricing power
- Same Property NOI growth of 2.3% is modest, suggesting stable rather than trophy-grade assets

### Vision Statement

**Management's Stated Vision:**
"Artis's vision is to become a **best-in-class real estate asset management and investment platform focused on value investing**."

This vision statement emphasizes:
1. **Asset management orientation:** Suggests focus on operational excellence and property-level value creation
2. **Value investing discipline:** Implies contrarian or opportunistic approach to acquisitions and capital deployment
3. **Best-in-class aspiration:** Signals intent to compete with higher-quality peers despite current challenges

**Alignment with Current Strategy:**
The vision of "value investing" is consistent with the current asset disposition program, where management states intention to "sell assets at or above IFRS values." However, the aggressive distribution policy (187.5% AFFO payout) conflicts with capital preservation principles typically associated with value investing.

---

### Business Strategy

### Strategic Priorities (Q2 2025 MD&A)

Artis REIT is executing a **portfolio repositioning and deleveraging strategy** characterized by three primary initiatives:

#### 1. Asset Monetization Program

**Strategy:**
"The REIT has been unlocking value through the monetization of certain assets."

**Q2 2025 Execution:**
- Sold one retail property in Canada for $4.75 million
- Continuing to "evaluate the sale of a portion of its industrial, office and retail assets in an opportunistic and disciplined manner"

**Management Objectives:**
- Sell assets "at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values"
- Maximize value "on a tax-efficient basis"
- Portfolio rationalization across all three asset classes (industrial, office, retail)

**Credit Implications:**
- Asset sales at or above book value support balance sheet protection
- Modest Q2 sales volume ($4.8M) suggests slow execution pace
- Tax-efficiency focus may constrain sale timing or structure
- "Opportunistic" approach may delay deleveraging if market pricing is weak

#### 2. Normal Course Issuer Bid (Unit Buyback Program)

**Strategy:**
"Artis continues to view its Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) as a valuable tool to enhance unitholder value."

**Program Details:**
- NCIB renewed effective December 19, 2024
- Authorized to purchase up to 10% of public float of common units
- Maximum daily purchase: 25% of average daily trading volume
- Program runs through December 18, 2025

**Strategic Rationale:**
Management appears to believe units trade below intrinsic value, making buybacks value-accretive. This is supported by market cap of ~$770-966M versus implied book equity of ~$1.5B, suggesting 35-49% discount to book value.

**Credit Implications:**
- **Negative for credit:** Buybacks divert capital from debt reduction
- **Conflicts with deleveraging:** Competes with asset sale proceeds for capital allocation
- **Signals financial aggression:** Prioritizes unitholder returns over balance sheet strength
- **Questionable priority:** Given 187.5% AFFO payout and 1.81x coverage, buybacks are inappropriate use of capital

#### 3. Distribution Policy (Implicit Strategy)

**Current Policy:**
- Quarterly distribution: $0.15 per common unit
- Annualized: $0.60 per unit
- No stated intention to modify despite 187.5% AFFO payout ratio

**Strategic Implications:**
Management appears committed to maintaining distributions despite unsustainability, likely for:
1. **Unit price support:** Distribution cuts typically trigger unit price declines
2. **Income investor base retention:** REITs attract yield-focused investors
3. **Market signaling:** Distribution cut signals financial distress; management may be avoiding negative signal

**Credit Implications:**
- **Fundamentally unsustainable:** Requires asset sales or debt increases to fund shortfall
- **Erodes financial flexibility:** Consumes cash that should be directed to debt reduction
- **Prevents rating upgrade:** Even with successful deleveraging, unsustainable payout caps rating at Ba category

### Inferred Strategic Profile

**Classification: Harvest/Liquidation Strategy with Unitholder Return Maximization**

Based on the observed metrics and stated priorities, Artis is executing a **hybrid harvest-liquidation strategy**:

**Characteristics:**
1. **Shrinking asset base:** Asset sales without replacement acquisitions indicates portfolio wind-down
2. **Maximizing distributions:** 187.5% AFFO payout prioritizes current income over growth
3. **Unit buybacks:** NCIB further supports unitholder returns at expense of balance sheet
4. **Limited capex:** High FFO-to-AFFO spread (52%) suggests significant deferred maintenance
5. **No growth initiatives:** No mention of acquisitions, developments, or portfolio expansion

**Comparable REIT Strategies:**
- **NOT growth-oriented:** No acquisition pipeline, development projects, or expansion plans
- **NOT harvest-stable:** Payout ratio far exceeds 100%; asset base shrinking
- **MOST SIMILAR TO:** REITs in managed wind-down or transition to alternative structure

**Alternative Interpretation:**
Artis may be positioning for:
1. **Portfolio sale:** Preparing entire portfolio for bulk sale to larger REIT or private equity
2. **Internalization transaction:** Conversion from REIT to REOC or privatization
3. **Strategic merger:** Combination with peer REIT to achieve scale and cost synergies

The combination of aggressive distribution policy, unit buybacks, and asset sales at book value suggests management is **maximizing near-term unitholder returns** rather than building long-term franchise value.

### Strategic Alignment with Credit Profile

**Misalignment Concerns:**
1. **Distribution policy conflicts with deleveraging:** Cannot achieve material debt reduction while paying 187.5% of AFFO
2. **NCIB conflicts with refinancing needs:** Buybacks divert capital from addressing 1.81x coverage weakness
3. **"Opportunistic" asset sales conflict with urgency:** Leverage and coverage metrics suggest need for accelerated deleveraging

**Required Strategic Pivot for Credit Improvement:**
To achieve Ba1 or investment grade rating, Artis would need to:
1. **Cut distribution to $0.08-0.10/unit** (align with AFFO generation)
2. **Suspend NCIB temporarily** (redirect capital to debt reduction)
3. **Accelerate asset sales to $200M+ over 18 months** (materially delever)
4. **Improve operational metrics** (occupancy to 92%+, NOI growth to 4%+)

**Probability of Strategic Pivot:** Low (15-20%)
- Management has not signaled willingness to cut distribution despite 187.5% payout
- NCIB was renewed in December 2024, suggesting ongoing commitment
- "Opportunistic" language on asset sales suggests no urgency

### Conclusion

Artis REIT's business strategy is characterized by **active portfolio repositioning with aggressive unitholder return orientation**. The REIT is executing asset sales to unlock value while maintaining elevated distributions (187.5% AFFO payout) and unit buybacks through the NCIB. This strategy prioritizes current unitholder returns over balance sheet strength and financial flexibility.

From a credit perspective, the strategy is **inconsistent with rating improvement** and creates **downgrade risk** if execution falters. The lack of distribution policy reset despite obvious unsustainability suggests management is either:
1. Confident in near-term asset sale success to fund shortfall, or
2. Prioritizing unit price support over long-term financial stability

The Ba2 rating with Negative outlook reflects these strategic tensions and the challenging path to achieving both deleveraging and unitholder return objectives simultaneously.

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case Scenario (50-60% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. Asset sales of $100-125M over next 12 months at 95-100% of IFRS book value
2. Proceeds directed 100% to debt reduction (NCIB suspended temporarily)
3. Occupancy stabilizes at 87-89% range with modest leasing activity
4. Same Property NOI growth of 2-3% annually driven by renewal spreads
5. Distribution maintained at $0.15/unit quarterly (policy unchanged)
6. No major debt refinancing; maturing debt rolled at similar rates (±50bps)

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- Gross Assets: $2,486M (down from $2,611M due to asset sales)
- Total Debt: $979M (down from $1,079M after $100M debt paydown)
- **Debt/Assets: 39.4%** (improved from 41.3%)
- Net Debt: $962M (from $1,062M)
- Annualized NOI: $123M (up 2% from $122.9M implied current)
- Annualized Interest: $65M (down from $67.7M due to debt reduction)
- **NOI Interest Coverage: 1.89x** (improved from 1.81x)
- AFFO: ~$8.5M quarterly (modest improvement from $8.2M)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio: 176%** (down from 187.5% but still unsustainable)

**Rating Impact:** **Stable at Ba2**
- Modest improvement in leverage and coverage keeps rating at Ba2
- AFFO payout remains deeply unsustainable, preventing upgrade
- Deleveraging trajectory is positive but pace is slow

**Probability Justification:** 50-60%
- This represents management's stated strategy of opportunistic asset sales
- Assumes moderate success in disposition program and stable operations
- Conservative assumption that distribution policy is maintained (likely given recent history)

---

### Upside Case (20-30% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. Accelerated asset sales of $250-300M over 12-18 months at 100-105% of book value
2. Distribution cut to $0.10/unit quarterly (33% reduction) or AFFO improvement through NOI growth
3. 100% of asset sale proceeds to debt reduction
4. Occupancy improves to 90-92% through successful leasing campaigns
5. Same Property NOI growth accelerates to 4-5% due to strong renewal spreads (5-8% range)
6. Successful refinancing of maturing debt at 50-75bps below current rates

**Pro Forma Metrics (18 months forward):**
- Gross Assets: $2,350M (down from $2,611M)
- Total Debt: $829M (down from $1,079M after $250M debt paydown)
- **Debt/Assets: 35.3%** (improved from 41.3%; enters Baa range)
- Net Debt: $815M (from $1,062M)
- Annualized NOI: $132M (up 7% from current $122.9M)
- Annualized Interest: $53M (down materially from $67.7M)
- **NOI Interest Coverage: 2.49x** (improved from 1.81x; enters Baa range)
- AFFO: ~$11M quarterly (significant improvement from $8.2M)
- Distributions: $9.6M quarterly at $0.10/unit (from $14.5M at $0.15/unit)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio: 87%** (sustainable range; improved from 187.5%)

**Rating Impact:** **Upgrade to Ba1 or Baa3**
- Coverage improvement to 2.49x and leverage reduction to 35.3% both support Baa category
- Sustainable AFFO payout of 87% demonstrates financial discipline
- Combined improvements could justify Ba1 in near term, Baa3 within 24 months

**Probability Justification:** 20-30%
- Requires difficult decision to cut distribution by 33%
- Management has not signaled willingness to reduce distributions despite 187.5% AFFO payout
- Asset sales of $250-300M within 18 months is ambitious given $4.8M sold in Q2 2025
- Occupancy improvement to 90-92% and NOI growth acceleration both require strong execution
- This scenario represents "best case operational and strategic execution"

**Key Catalyst:** Board decision to reset distribution policy to sustainable level

---

### Downside Case (10-20% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. Asset sales severely limited to $25-50M over 12 months due to weak buyer demand or pricing
2. Forced to accept 85-90% of book value on dispositions (10-15% discount)
3. Distribution policy maintained at $0.15/unit despite AFFO weakness
4. Occupancy declines to 82-84% due to major tenant default (100,000+ SF space)
5. Same Property NOI declines (-2% to -3%) due to negative renewal spreads or expense pressures
6. Modest debt increase of $25-50M to fund distribution shortfall

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- Gross Assets: $2,561M (minimal decline from $2,611M)
- Total Debt: $1,104M (up from $1,079M; debt increases to fund distributions)
- **Debt/Assets: 43.1%** (deteriorated from 41.3%)
- Net Debt: $1,090M (from $1,062M)
- Annualized NOI: $116M (down 5% from current $122.9M)
- Annualized Interest: $70M (up from $67.7M due to higher debt balance and rates)
- **NOI Interest Coverage: 1.66x** (deteriorated from 1.81x; approaching covenant risk)
- AFFO: ~$6.5M quarterly (decline from $8.2M)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio: 223%** (severely unsustainable; deteriorated from 187.5%)

**Rating Impact:** **Downgrade to Ba3**
- Coverage of 1.66x approaches typical covenant threshold of 1.50x
- Debt/Assets of 43.1% moves closer to Ba/B boundary at 45%
- AFFO payout exceeding 200% indicates severe financial stress
- Increasing debt to fund distributions is credit negative

**Probability Justification:** 10-20%
- Represents adverse but plausible scenario
- Major tenant default risk exists in any commercial real estate portfolio
- Asset sale market weakness (forcing discounts) is realistic in downturn scenario
- Management willingness to increase debt to maintain distributions is concerning but possible
- Lower probability than base case but meaningful tail risk

**Downgrade Trigger:** Coverage sustained below 1.70x for 2+ quarters

---

### Stress Case (5-10% probability)

**Assumptions:**
1. **Severe recession scenario:** GDP decline 2-3%, unemployment rise to 7-8%
2. **EBITDA/NOI decline of 15-18%** due to:
   - Multiple tenant bankruptcies (200,000+ SF total vacancies)
   - Occupancy decline to 75-78%
   - Negative renewal spreads of -5% to -10%
   - Operating expense increases (energy, property taxes, insurance)
3. **Unable to refinance maturing debt** at reasonable terms
   - $200M+ of debt matures; forced to accept onerous terms
   - Interest rates 200-300bps higher than current
   - Potential covenant amendment fees and restrictions
4. **Asset sales impossible** due to frozen transaction market
   - Buyers absent; no bid for properties
   - Book value marks decline 15-20%
5. **Distribution cut by 50%** to $0.075/unit but still insufficient
6. **Potential covenant breaches** on debt/assets or coverage ratios

**Pro Forma Metrics (Stressed):**
- Gross Assets: $2,350M (down 10% from $2,611M due to fair value writedowns)
- Total Debt: $1,079M (unchanged; unable to reduce)
- **Debt/Assets: 45.9%** (deteriorated from 41.3%; at Ba/B boundary)
- Net Debt: $1,065M (minimal change)
- Annualized NOI: $102M (down 17% from current $122.9M)
- Annualized Interest: $80M (up 18% from $67.7M due to refinancing at higher rates)
- **NOI Interest Coverage: 1.28x** (severely deteriorated from 1.81x; **COVENANT BREACH RISK**)
- AFFO: ~$3.5M quarterly (down 57% from $8.2M)
- Distributions: $7.25M quarterly at $0.075/unit (50% cut from $0.15)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio: 207%** (still unsustainable despite 50% distribution cut)

**Rating Impact:** **Multi-notch downgrade to B1 or B2**
- Coverage of 1.28x is below typical covenant threshold; breach likely
- Debt/Assets approaching 46% enters B category territory
- Asset value declines of 10% create negative equity concerns
- Inability to refinance maturing debt creates liquidity crisis

**Additional Stress Factors:**
- **Covenant waivers required:** Likely need to negotiate with lenders; may face:
  - Increased interest rates (penalty pricing)
  - Accelerated amortization requirements
  - Restrictions on distributions and asset sales
  - Additional collateral or guarantee requirements
- **Liquidity crisis potential:** If unable to refinance, may need:
  - Emergency asset sales at material discounts (20-30% below book)
  - Equity issuance at depressed prices (highly dilutive)
  - Suspension of distributions entirely
- **Going concern risk:** Severe stress could lead to:
  - REIT restructuring or wind-down
  - Asset sales to satisfy debt obligations
  - Potential distressed M&A transaction

**Probability Justification:** 5-10%
- Represents tail risk scenario requiring multiple adverse events
- Recession probability exists but severe 15-18% NOI decline requires substantial tenant failures
- Inability to refinance debt is low probability but high impact
- Covenant breach scenarios are realistic if coverage falls below 1.50x
- This is a "stress test" rather than expected outcome

**Key Indicators to Monitor:**
- Quarterly NOI trends (watch for declines exceeding 5%)
- Occupancy trajectory (alert if falls below 85%)
- Debt maturity schedule (concentration risk in any single year)
- Credit facility terms and covenant headroom
- Management commentary on distribution policy sustainability

### Downgrade Trigger Summary Table

| Trigger Metric | Current Level | Watch Level | Downgrade to Ba3 | Downgrade to B1/B2 |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **NOI Interest Coverage** | 1.81x | <1.75x | <1.60x | <1.40x |
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | 41.3% | >43% | >47% | >52% |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 187.5% | >200% | >225% | Increase debt to fund |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 87.8% | <85% | <82% | <78% |
| **Same Property NOI Growth** | +2.3% | 0% to -1% | -3% to -5% | -10%+ |
| **Net Debt ($ millions)** | $1,062 | >$1,100 | >$1,150 | >$1,200 |

**Buffer Analysis (from current to downgrade threshold):**

| Metric | Current | Downgrade Threshold (Ba3) | Percentage Buffer | Margin for Error |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Coverage | 1.81x | 1.60x | 13% | Low - single adverse quarter could approach |
| Leverage | 41.3% | 47% | 14% | Moderate - requires asset value decline or debt increase |
| AFFO Payout | 187.5% | 225% | 20% | Moderate - already in distress territory |
| Occupancy | 87.8% | 82% | 7% | Low - major tenant default could trigger |

**Conclusion:**
Artis REIT has **limited buffers to downgrade**, particularly on coverage (13% buffer) and occupancy (7% buffer). The Base Case scenario maintains the Ba2 rating but does not provide meaningful improvement. The Upside Case requires difficult strategic decisions (distribution cut) that management has not signaled. The Downside and Stress Cases illustrate material downgrade risk if operations deteriorate or the asset sale program fails.

**Recommended Monitoring Frequency:** Quarterly review of coverage, occupancy, and asset sale progress
