## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

Artis REIT is a diversified commercial real estate investment trust undergoing strategic portfolio transformation through asset monetization and repositioning. With gross assets of $2.61 billion across 83 properties (9.7 million SF) in Canada and the United States, the REIT operates across industrial, office, retail, and residential asset classes. The credit profile reflects elevated leverage (52.5% Debt/Assets), weak interest coverage (1.81x NOI/Interest), and an unsustainable distribution policy (187.5% AFFO payout ratio), offset partially by minimal dilution risk, strategic asset sales progress, and enhanced governance disclosure.

## Credit Strengths

**Quantified Positive Factors:**

1. **Minimal Share Dilution Demonstrates Disciplined Capital Allocation**
   Share dilution of 2.01% (1,500 restricted units + 500 deferred units = 2,000 dilutive units vs. 99,444 basic units) is within the "low materiality" range (1-3%) and reflects normal equity compensation practices. Critically, there are zero convertible debentures outstanding, eliminating forced conversion risk and potential debt-like equity overhang. This compares favorably to REITs with material convertible positions (5-10% dilution) that constrain debt capacity and create balance sheet uncertainty.

2. **Enhanced Governance and Disclosure Transparency**
   Detailed dilution breakdown in Q2 2025 MD&A (page 21) showing instrument-by-instrument reconciliation (RSUs: 1,500 units, DSUs: 500 units, calculated dilution: 2.01% matching reported dilution) demonstrates superior disclosure practices relative to peers reporting only basic/diluted unit totals. Enhanced transparency supports credit analysis and reflects strong governance culture.

3. **Diversified Asset Class and Geographic Exposure Reduces Concentration Risk**
   Portfolio spans four asset classes (industrial, office, retail, residential) across Canada and United States markets, mitigating single-sector downturns. Diversification supports occupancy maintenance during individual market stress, though concentration in office assets (primary NOI contributor per portfolio mix) creates exposure to structural office sector headwinds.

4. **Strategic Asset Sales at/Above Book Value Support NAV Protection**
   Q2 2025 retail disposition ($4.75M sale price) executed as part of value-maximization strategy. Management's stated goal of selling assets "at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values" on a tax-efficient basis, if achieved, protects net asset value per unit and supports deleveraging without equity dilution. Continued execution critical to credit story.

5. **Positive Same-Property NOI Growth Indicates Operational Stability**
   Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% (annualized) demonstrates ability to achieve rent increases and occupancy gains despite competitive markets. While modest, positive organic growth supports AFFO generation and partially offsets distribution burden.

---

---

## Credit Challenges

**Quantified Risk Factors:**

1. **Severely Unsustainable Distribution Policy Forces Capital Markets Reliance**
   AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% means the REIT distributes $1.875 for every $1.00 of adjusted funds from operations generated. With AFFO of $8.2M (annualized: ~$16.4M) and distributions of $0.15/unit (99,444 units = $14.9M annualized), the REIT must fund ~$14.3M annually through asset sales, debt issuance, or equity raises. This creates:
   - **Forced asset sale risk:** Must monetize properties even in weak markets to fund distributions
   - **Refinancing pressure:** Requires continuous capital markets access
   - **Equity dilution risk:** May need to issue units at depressed valuations if asset sales stall

   **Mitigant:** NCIB (Normal Course Issuer Bid) renewed December 2024 provides distribution management flexibility, but suspension/cut would signal distress to market.

2. **Below-Grade Interest Coverage Creates Covenant and Refinancing Vulnerability**
   NOI/Interest coverage of 1.81x compares unfavorably to:
   - **Investment grade minimum:** 3.0x+ for Baa rating
   - **High-yield REIT typical:** 2.5-3.0x for Ba rating
   - **Distressed threshold:** <2.0x signals potential covenant breach risk

   With annualized interest expense of $67.7M and total debt of $1,370M, the REIT has minimal margin for EBITDA decline (15-20% NOI drop would push coverage below 1.5x). Weak coverage limits refinancing negotiating power and increases spread risk on debt rollovers.

3. **Occupancy Below Market Averages Signals Leasing Challenges**
   Portfolio occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% including commitments) trails:
   - **Industrial REIT sector:** ~95-97% typical
   - **Diversified REIT sector:** ~91-93% typical
   - **Office sector (urban):** ~88-92% typical

   Below-market occupancy suggests tenant retention challenges, competitive market positioning, or asset quality concerns. Each 100 bps of occupancy decline reduces NOI by ~$1-2M annually, further pressuring coverage ratios. Achieving management's 90%+ occupancy target requires successful lease-up of 210-220 bps (2.1-2.2 percentage points), representing material execution risk.

4. **Asset Sale Execution Risk in Weak Commercial Real Estate Markets**
   Q2 2025 saw only one disposition ($4.75M retail property) compared to implied annual target of $50-100M+ based on deleveraging needs. Weak transaction volumes in Canadian commercial real estate (particularly office) create risk that:
   - Asset sales occur below IFRS values, impairing NAV per unit
   - Sales stall entirely, forcing distribution cuts or equity raises
   - Fire sale pricing emerges if liquidity needs become acute

   **Downside scenario:** If asset sales fall 50% short of target, AFFO payout would exceed 200%, requiring immediate distribution cut or $20-30M equity raise.

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

The Negative outlook reflects execution risk around Artis REIT's deleveraging strategy and unsustainable distribution policy over the next 12-18 months. Three scenarios drive outlook assessment:

**Base Case (60% probability): Rating Maintained at Ba2/BB**
Assumes:
- Asset sales of $75-125M over 12 months at 95-105% of book value
- Distribution maintained at $0.15/unit (~$15M annually) through asset sale proceeds
- Occupancy improvement to 89-91% through lease renewals and new commitments
- Same-property NOI growth sustained at 2-3%

**Pro forma deleveraging:**
- Asset sales of $100M less debt paydown of $75M → Debt/Assets improves to 49-50%
- NOI stable to +2% → Coverage improves to 1.85-1.90x
- AFFO payout ratio remains elevated at 170-180% (unsustainable but manageable near-term)

**Rating Impact:** Negative outlook maintained due to continued reliance on asset sales to fund distributions.

**Downside Case (30% probability): Downgrade to Ba3/BB-**
Triggers:
- Asset sales stall (<$50M over 12 months) due to market illiquidity
- Occupancy declines to 85-87% due to tenant non-renewals
- Same-property NOI contracts -1% to 0% due to rent concessions
- Distribution maintained, forcing $20-30M equity issuance at 15-20% discount to NAV

**Pro forma deterioration:**
- Minimal deleveraging → Debt/Assets remains 52-54%
- NOI decline + equity dilution → Coverage falls to 1.70-1.75x
- AFFO payout exceeds 200%, signaling distribution cut imminent

**Rating Impact:** Downgrade to Ba3 on weakened liquidity profile and increased financial risk.

**Upside Case (10% probability): Outlook Revised to Stable**
Triggers:
- Asset sales exceed $150M at 105-110% of book value
- Distribution cut to $0.10-0.12/unit (reducing payout to 125-150% of AFFO)
- Occupancy reaches 91-93% through successful leasing campaigns
- Same-property NOI growth accelerates to 3-4%

**Pro forma improvement:**
- Debt reduction of $100-125M → Debt/Assets improves to 47-48%
- NOI growth + lower distributions → Coverage improves to 2.0-2.2x
- AFFO payout ratio moves toward 140-150% (still elevated but improving trajectory)

**Rating Impact:** Outlook revised to Stable on improved financial flexibility and sustainable distribution policy.

**12-Month Forward View:**
Key monitoring metrics: quarterly asset sale volumes, distribution policy announcements, occupancy trends, and coverage ratio trajectory. A distribution cut announcement (positive for credit, negative for equity) would likely trigger Outlook revision to Stable if accompanied by meaningful deleveraging progress.

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

**Quantified Thresholds for Ba1/BB+ Rating:**

1. **Debt/Assets < 45%**
   Current: 52.5% → Requires $195M of debt reduction through asset sales or equity
   **Pathway:** Sell $250-300M of assets over 18-24 months at book value, deploy proceeds to debt paydown

2. **NOI/Interest Coverage > 2.5x**
   Current: 1.81x → Requires 38% NOI growth OR 28% interest expense reduction
   **Pathway:** Combination of (a) 10-15% NOI growth through occupancy gains + rent increases, (b) refinance $200-300M of debt at 50-75 bps lower rates, (c) modest distribution cut freeing $3-5M annually for debt paydown

3. **AFFO Payout Ratio < 90%**
   Current: 187.5% → Requires distribution cut to $0.07-0.08/unit OR doubling AFFO
   **Pathway:** Cut distribution to $0.08/unit (47% reduction), maintain through cycle, reinvest savings into debt reduction and portfolio quality improvements

4. **Occupancy Sustained > 92%**
   Current: 87.8% (89.0% with commitments) → Requires 420 bps improvement
   **Pathway:** Execute on existing lease commitments (+120 bps to 89.0%), achieve 300 bps additional through renewals and new leasing, demonstrate 12+ months of sustained >92% occupancy

5. **Track Record of Asset Sales at/Above Book Value**
   Current: Limited evidence (1 sale in Q2 2025)
   **Pathway:** Execute 6-8 dispositions over 12-18 months averaging 100-105% of IFRS values, demonstrating portfolio quality and management execution capability

**Timeframe:** 24-36 months of sustained improvement across all metrics required for upgrade. Near-term upgrade unlikely given current distribution policy and leverage levels.

---

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

**Quantified Trigger Points for B1/B+ Rating:**

1. **Debt/Assets > 55%**
   Current: 52.5% → Would occur if asset sales below book value or additional debt raised
   **Trigger Scenario:** $50M of asset sales at 85-90% of book value + $25M equity value write-down → Debt/Assets rises to 55-56%

2. **NOI/Interest Coverage < 1.5x**
   Current: 1.81x → Would occur with 17% NOI decline OR 20% interest expense increase
   **Trigger Scenario:** Major tenant default (100,000 SF at $20/SF = $2M NOI loss) + 100 bps refinancing rate increase on $500M of debt rollovers → Coverage falls to 1.45-1.50x

3. **AFFO Payout Ratio > 250%**
   Current: 187.5% → Would occur if AFFO declines 25% while distribution maintained
   **Trigger Scenario:** Same-property NOI contracts -5%, major capex requirement depletes AFFO by $2-3M → AFFO falls to $6M, payout rises to 248%

4. **Occupancy < 85%**
   Current: 87.8% → Would occur with 280 bps decline from tenant non-renewals
   **Trigger Scenario:** Office sector stress, 200,000 SF of non-renewals at quarter-end → Occupancy falls to 84-85%

5. **Covenant Breach or Liquidity Crisis**
   **Trigger Scenario:** Debt/Assets covenant typically 60-65% → Current 52.5% provides 7.5-12.5 point cushion, but rapid deterioration possible if forced to refinance in distressed conditions or asset sales stall entirely

6. **Distribution Suspension Without Credible Deleveraging Plan**
   **Trigger Scenario:** Distribution cut to $0 announced alongside minimal asset sale progress → Signals equity value impairment and inability to access capital markets, raises going-concern questions

**Near-Term Downgrade Risk (Next 6-12 Months):**
**Moderate (30% probability)** - primarily driven by asset sale execution risk and potential distribution policy crisis. Key watchpoints: Q3/Q4 2025 disposition volumes, lease expiry schedule management, and any refinancing announcements on debt maturing in 2025-2026.

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

### Moody's-Style 5-Factor Scorecard for REITs

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Ba | **Ba** | Gross assets of $2.61B places Artis in Ba category ($2-5B range). Smaller scale limits capital markets access, refinancing negotiating power, and geographic/tenant diversification relative to larger REITs ($10B+ for A, $20B+ for Aa). Portfolio of 83 properties (9.7M SF) provides moderate scale but concentration risk remains. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Ba/B | **Ba-** | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Mixed portfolio quality with exposure to structurally challenged office sector. Occupancy of 87.8% trails sector averages (91-93% for diversified REITs), indicating secondary market positioning or older vintage assets. Some assets likely non-core (hence disposition strategy). **Market Characteristics (12.5%):** Diversified across Canada/U.S. and four asset classes (industrial, office, retail, residential) provides cyclical protection, but office exposure creates secular headwinds. Industrial and residential holdings positive; office and some retail challenged. Competitive markets with limited pricing power (2.3% same-property NOI growth). **Combined:** Ba- reflects below-average asset quality and competitive market positioning. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Ba | **Ba** | TSX listing (AX.UN) and OTCQX listing (ARESF) provide public market access, but weak unit price performance (implied by 187.5% payout ratio and asset sale strategy) constrains equity issuance capacity. NCIB active (renewed Dec 2024), suggesting management views units as undervalued. Debt markets accessible but likely at high-yield spreads given leverage and coverage metrics. Enhanced dilution disclosure (governance score: enhanced) is positive, but overall capital access constrained by financial profile. Refinancing risk moderate to high given weak coverage (1.81x). |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Ba | **Ba** | **Debt/Gross Assets: 52.5%** → Solidly Ba category (45-55% range), approaching B threshold (>55%). Net debt ratio of 51.8% similarly elevated. **NOI/Interest Coverage: 1.81x** → Below Ba range midpoint (2.0-3.0x target), closer to B category (<2.0x). Weak coverage is most concerning credit metric, indicating minimal cushion for NOI volatility or interest rate increases. **FFO Payout: 88.2%** → Manageable on FFO basis but misleading given AFFO payout of 187.5%. **Overall:** Ba score with negative bias due to weak coverage offsetting moderate leverage. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | B | **B** | Distribution policy is aggressively unsustainable (187.5% AFFO payout), requiring continuous asset sales or capital markets access to fund distributions. This signals **very aggressive financial risk appetite** characteristic of B-rated financial policy. Management's asset sale strategy aims to strengthen balance sheet, but maintaining distributions during deleveraging contradicts stated goals. Positive factors: (1) NCIB demonstrates willingness to manage distributions, (2) enhanced disclosure shows governance awareness, (3) no convertible debt limits forced dilution. However, current policy prioritizes distributions over balance sheet repair, placing in B category for financial policy despite Ba operational profile. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Ba2 / BB** | **Ba2** | **Indicated Rating: Ba2 (Moody's) / BB (S&P)** - Weighted scoring yields Ba2, reflecting (1) moderate scale, (2) below-average business profile, (3) constrained capital access, (4) elevated leverage with weak coverage, and (5) aggressive financial policy. Rating sits in high-yield speculative grade with primary risks being refinancing exposure and distribution sustainability. Positive rating momentum requires distribution cut and sustained deleveraging progress. |

**Rating Justification:**
Ba2/BB rating reflects a REIT with meaningful operational capabilities (diversified portfolio, public market access, positive NOI growth) offset by aggressive financial policy and elevated credit risk metrics. The rating balances Artis's real estate franchise value against near-term refinancing and distribution policy risks. This is a "prove it" rating requiring demonstration of deleveraging execution and financial policy discipline to achieve positive momentum.

**Key Rating Constraint:**
Financial Policy (B-rated) acts as primary rating constraint, preventing higher rating despite moderate operational profile. A distribution cut to sustainable levels (80-90% AFFO payout) would immediately improve scorecard to Ba1/BB+ range, assuming leverage and coverage metrics stabilize.

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**1. FFO vs. AFFO Divergence Signals Hidden Capital Intensity**

- **FFO:** $17.0M (Q2 2025, annualized basis)
- **AFFO:** $8.2M (Q2 2025, annualized basis)
- **Divergence:** AFFO is 48% of FFO, indicating $8.8M of adjustments

**Implication:** The REIT's business model requires significant ongoing capital investment (sustaining capex, tenant improvements, leasing costs) not captured in FFO. AFFO of $8.2M represents true distributable cash flow, making the 187.5% payout ratio even more concerning. Typical REITs see AFFO at 70-85% of FFO; Artis's 48% ratio suggests capital-intensive asset base or deferred maintenance requirements.

**Credit Impact:** Negative - indicates lower-quality cash flow sustainability and higher ongoing capital needs.

---

**2. Per-Unit Metrics Show Minimal Basic/Diluted Spread**

- **FFO per unit:** $0.17 (basic and diluted effectively equal given 2.01% dilution)
- **AFFO per unit:** $0.08 (basic and diluted effectively equal)
- **Distributions per unit:** $0.15

**Calculation Check:**
- Basic units: 99,444
- Diluted units: 101,444
- Dilution impact: 2,000 units / 99,444 = 2.01%
- Per-unit dilution effect: ~$0.003-0.005 per metric (immaterial)

**Implication:** Equity compensation structure (RSUs + DSUs) is non-dilutive to credit metrics. Unlike REITs with 8-10% dilution from convertible debentures, Artis's capital structure is straightforward with no material conversion overhang.

**Credit Impact:** Neutral to slightly positive - eliminates forced conversion scenarios and simplifies capital structure analysis.

---

**3. Portfolio Occupancy Composition Reveals Leasing Momentum**

- **In-place occupancy:** 87.8%
- **Committed occupancy:** 89.0%
- **Lease-up pipeline:** 120 bps (1.2 percentage points)

**Implication:** The 120 bps of committed-but-not-yet-occupied space represents near-term positive momentum. If commitments convert successfully, occupancy reaches 89.0% by Q3-Q4 2025, improving NOI by ~$1.0-1.5M annually. However, failure to convert commitments (tenant defaults, construction delays) would signal deeper leasing challenges.

**Watch Item:** Track Q3 2025 occupancy closely - should show movement toward 89% if commitments are real.

**Credit Impact:** Neutral - positive momentum offset by execution risk.

---

**4. Same-Property NOI Growth of 2.3% Lags Inflation**

- **Reported same-property NOI growth:** 2.3% (annualized)
- **Canadian CPI (2024-2025):** ~2.0-2.5%
- **Real NOI growth:** ~0-0.3% (nominal growth minus inflation)

**Implication:** Artis is barely keeping pace with inflation on a same-property basis, indicating limited pricing power. Strong REITs achieve 3-5% same-property NOI growth through rent escalations and occupancy gains. Artis's 2.3% suggests competitive markets, weak tenant demand, or portfolio mix challenges (office drag).

**Peer Comparison:**
- Industrial REITs: 4-6% same-property NOI growth typical
- Office REITs: -2% to +2% range (sector challenged)
- Diversified REITs: 2-4% typical

**Credit Impact:** Negative - indicates limited organic growth runway and reliance on acquisitions or asset quality improvements for NOI expansion.

---

**5. Interest Expense Run-Rate Analysis**

- **Q2 2025 interest expense:** $16.9M
- **Annualized (x4):** $67.7M
- **Total debt:** $1,369.6M
- **Implied interest rate:** 4.94%

**Implication:** Weighted average interest rate of ~4.9% is reasonable for 2025 environment (Government of Canada 5-year: ~3.0%, REIT credit spread: 150-200 bps = 4.5-5.0%). However, any refinancing at higher rates (if credit spreads widen or government rates rise) would pressure coverage further.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- +50 bps rate increase on $500M refinancing → +$2.5M annual interest → Coverage falls to 1.75x
- +100 bps rate increase on $500M refinancing → +$5.0M annual interest → Coverage falls to 1.68x

**Credit Impact:** Negative - limited cushion for rising rates given already weak coverage.

---

**6. Dilution Disclosure Excellence Signals Governance Quality**

- **Source:** Q2 2025 MD&A page 21 (explicit reference in metrics)
- **Content:** Instrument-by-instrument breakdown (RSUs: 1,500, DSUs: 500, options: 0, convertibles: 0, warrants: 0)
- **Reconciliation:** Calculated dilution (2.01%) matches reported dilution exactly

**Implication:** Management provides institutional-grade disclosure exceeding minimum TSX requirements. Detailed dilution reconciliation allows investors to assess equity compensation philosophy, conversion risks, and capital structure clarity. Contrast with REITs reporting only basic/diluted totals.

**Governance Score:** Enhanced (vs. Standard) - supports higher confidence in financial reporting quality and management transparency.

**Credit Impact:** Positive - enhanced disclosure reduces information risk and supports credit analysis confidence.

### Peer Analysis and Credit Positioning

**1. Leverage: Artis Significantly Underleveraged Relative to Credit Quality**

Artis's Debt/Assets of 52.5% is **12.1 percentage points higher** than the peer average of 40.4%, placing it in the bottom tier of the peer group. Only Allied Properties (44.0%) approaches Artis's leverage, and Allied is executing a credible deleveraging plan ($300M asset sale target for 2025).

**Key Insight:** Dream Industrial (37-38%) and Granite (36%) operate with Ba/BB-rated balance sheets at significantly lower leverage, demonstrating that Artis's 52.5% is not industry-standard for diversified REITs. To reach peer average leverage, Artis would need to reduce debt by $315M (~23% debt reduction) through asset sales.

**Rating Implication:** Artis's leverage alone justifies Ba2 rating and prevents upgrade to Ba1 unless sustained deleveraging demonstrated.

---

**2. Coverage: Artis Has Weakest Interest Coverage in Peer Group**

NOI/Interest coverage of 1.81x is **1.3x below peer average** (3.1x) and represents bottom-quartile performance. Even Allied Properties, facing urban office sector challenges, likely maintains 1.9-2.1x coverage through higher-quality asset base.

**Key Insight:** Granite and Dream Industrial achieve 4.0-5.0x coverage through combination of (1) lower leverage, (2) higher-quality industrial assets generating stronger NOI margins, and (3) conservative financial policy. Artis's 1.81x coverage signals either (a) excessive leverage relative to NOI generation, (b) higher interest rate debt structure, or (c) weaker operating margins.

**Calculation:**
- To reach peer average coverage of 3.1x: Artis needs to increase NOI by 71% OR reduce interest expense by 42%
- Realistic pathway: Reduce debt by $400M (29% reduction) → Interest expense falls to ~$47M → Coverage improves to 2.6x (closer to peer median)

**Rating Implication:** Weak coverage is primary credit differentiator vs. higher-rated peers and key constraint on investment grade pathway.

---

**3. Payout Ratios: Artis's 187.5% AFFO Payout is Uniquely Unsustainable**

AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% is **99.5 percentage points higher** than peer average (88%) and more than double typical REIT sustainable levels (70-90%). Even Allied Properties, the weakest peer, maintains AFFO payout around 110-130%.

**Key Insight:** No investment-grade REIT operates with 180%+ AFFO payout sustainably. This policy signals either (1) management belief in imminent AFFO growth (requires 50%+ AFFO increase to reach 125% payout), (2) commitment to asset sales to fund distributions (risky strategy), or (3) pending distribution cut (credit positive, equity negative).

**Peer Best Practice:**
- Dream Industrial / Granite: 70-85% AFFO payout → Retain 15-30% for growth capex and deleveraging
- H&R REIT: 85-95% AFFO payout → Balanced distribution/reinvestment
- Allied Properties: 110-130% AFFO payout (elevated due to transformation, but improving)

**Rating Implication:** Artis's distribution policy alone prevents investment-grade rating consideration and creates B-category financial policy score.

---

**4. Occupancy: Artis Trails Peers by 4.3 Percentage Points**

Occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% with commitments) is **4.3 points below peer average** (92.1%), indicating weaker tenant demand or higher tenant turnover. Granite (95.8%) and Dream Industrial (96-97%) demonstrate industrial sector strength, while Artis's diversified portfolio creates occupancy drag.

**Key Insight:** Each 100 bps of occupancy gap represents ~$1.0-1.5M of lost NOI annually for Artis's 9.7M SF portfolio. The 430 bps gap to peer average = ~$4.3-6.5M annual NOI shortfall. Closing this gap would improve coverage from 1.81x to ~2.1-2.3x, moving toward peer median.

**Pathway to Peer Parity:**
- Execute on committed leases (+120 bps to 89.0%)
- Achieve 3.0-3.5 percentage points additional through renewals and new leasing
- Dispose of low-occupancy non-core assets (positive for portfolio quality, negative for scale)

**Rating Implication:** Below-peer occupancy reflects lower business quality and constrains organic NOI growth.

---

**5. Same-Property NOI Growth: Artis Lags by 1.2 Percentage Points**

Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% is **1.2 points below peer average** (3.5%), indicating limited pricing power or tenant turnover challenges. Industrial-focused peers (Dream Industrial 4-5%, Granite 5-6%) drive peer average higher, while Artis's office exposure creates drag.

**Key Insight:** Artis's 2.3% growth barely covers inflation (~2.0-2.5%), providing minimal real NOI expansion. Peers achieve 1.5-3.5 percentage points higher growth through (1) stronger markets (industrial), (2) rent escalations (CPI + 1-2%), and (3) occupancy gains.

**Credit Impact:** Lower organic growth forces reliance on acquisitions or major capex projects to grow NOI, both of which pressure already-weak balance sheet. Contrast with Granite/Dream Industrial, which fund growth from retained AFFO.

---

### Where Artis Ranks Relative to Peers

**Credit Metrics Ranking (1 = Best, 5 = Worst):**

| Metric | Artis Rank | Peer in 1st | Peer in 5th |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Debt/Assets | 5th (worst) | Granite (36%) | Artis (52.5%) |
| Interest Coverage | 5th (worst) | Granite (~5x) | Artis (1.81x) |
| AFFO Payout | 5th (worst) | Granite (~75%) | Artis (187.5%) |
| Occupancy | 4th | Granite (95.8%) | Allied (84.9%) |
| NOI Growth | 5th (worst) | Granite (~6%) | Artis (2.3%) |

**Overall Credit Positioning:** Artis ranks **last (5th) in four of five key credit metrics** and second-to-last in occupancy. This bottom-tier positioning within the peer group justifies Ba2/BB rating relative to peers' higher ratings:

- **Granite REIT:** BBB/Baa3 range (investment grade) - superior metrics across all categories
- **Dream Industrial REIT:** BBB-/Ba1 range (investment grade/high-yield borderline) - much lower leverage and higher coverage
- **H&R REIT:** Ba1/BB+ range - better leverage, coverage, and payout discipline
- **Allied Properties REIT:** Ba2/BB range - similar challenges but improving trends and credible deleveraging plan
- **Artis REIT:** Ba2/BB - weakest credit profile but operational franchise value supports current rating

---

### Key Differentiators: What Separates Artis from Higher-Rated Peers?

**Upward rating mobility requires:**

1. **Adopt peer-standard distribution policy:** Cut AFFO payout to 80-90% (peer average: 88%)
2. **Execute sustained deleveraging:** Reduce Debt/Assets by 5-7 percentage points toward 45-47% (peer average: 40%)
3. **Strengthen coverage:** Improve to 2.5x+ through combination of NOI growth and debt reduction
4. **Improve occupancy:** Close 3-4 percentage point gap to peer average through successful leasing
5. **Demonstrate asset sale execution:** Prove ability to monetize assets at/above book value over 4-6 quarters

**Timeframe:** 18-24 months of sustained improvement required to close gap to Ba1/BB+ peers (H&R REIT, Allied Properties improving trajectory). Investment grade (Baa3/BBB-) likely 3-5 years away even with perfect execution.

---

### Business Strategy

**Vision Statement:**

"Artis's vision is to become a best-in-class real estate asset management and investment platform focused on value investing."

**Core Strategy:**

Artis's strategy is to generate meaningful long-term growth in net asset value (NAV) per unit by strengthening its balance sheet, driving organic growth, and executing value investing principles. As part of this strategy, Artis concentrates ownership in the highest and best risk-adjusted return opportunities to maximize long-term value for unitholders.

**Strategic Pillars (Q2 2025 Update):**

### 1. Asset Monetization and Portfolio Optimization

**Dispositions Strategy:**
- Artis is unlocking value through opportunistic monetization of non-core assets
- Q2 2025 activity: Sold one retail property in Canada for $4.75M
- Ongoing strategy: Evaluate sale of portions of industrial, office, and retail portfolio in disciplined manner
- **Target:** Sell assets at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values on a tax-efficient basis
- **Purpose:** Strengthen balance sheet, reduce leverage, improve portfolio quality

**Implication for Credit:**
- Positive: Deleveraging through asset sales reduces refinancing risk
- Risk: Execution dependent on market liquidity and pricing (weak CRE markets create fire-sale risk)
- Monitor: Quarterly asset sale volumes and pricing relative to book value

### 2. Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)

**Capital Allocation Tool:**
- Renewed NCIB effective December 19, 2024
- Maximum purchases authorized:
  - Common Units: 4,975,917 (5.1% of outstanding)
  - Series E Preferred Units: 291,560
  - Series I Preferred Units: 421,775
- **Management View:** NCIB represents valuable tool to enhance unitholder value
- **Implication:** Suggests management believes units trade below intrinsic value

**Credit Perspective:**
- Neutral to Negative: NCIB competes with debt reduction for capital deployment
- Signal: Active NCIB usage indicates management prioritizes unit buybacks over deleveraging
- Watch: If NCIB activity accelerates while leverage remains elevated, negative credit signal

### 3. Balance Sheet Strengthening (Implied Strategy)

**Evidence from Financial Policy:**
- Asset sales program aimed at debt reduction (primary use of proceeds)
- Moderate deleveraging progress (Q2 2025 base case projects 51-52% Debt/Assets vs. 52.5% current)
- Distribution policy maintains $0.15/unit despite 187.5% AFFO payout (implies confidence in asset sale proceeds)

**Inferred Priorities:**
1. Maintain distributions to support unit price and unitholder relations
2. Fund distributions through asset sales while maintaining/modestly reducing leverage
3. Avoid equity dilution (evidenced by minimal 2.01% dilution and NCIB activity)
4. Preserve optionality through diversified portfolio

**Credit Assessment:**
- **Current Strategy = "Harvest/Transition"** - Maintaining distributions while gradually repositioning portfolio
- Contrast with pure deleveraging strategy (would suspend distributions, aggressively sell assets)
- Risk: Strategy assumes asset sale markets remain liquid and pricing holds

### 4. Organic Growth Focus

**Operating Strategy:**
- Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% indicates focus on lease management and occupancy
- Committed occupancy of 89.0% (vs. 87.8% in-place) shows active leasing pipeline
- Asset class diversification reduces single-sector risk
- Canada/U.S. geographic split provides market diversification

**Execution Priorities (inferred from metrics):**
- Lease renewal management (maintain occupancy near 88-90%)
- Rent escalations matching or slightly exceeding inflation
- Selective tenant improvements and capital projects to support leasing
- Portfolio pruning through asset sales (exit lower-quality/lower-growth assets)

**Credit Perspective:**
- Modest organic growth (2.3%) limits deleveraging capacity without asset sales
- Strategy requires external capital (asset sales, debt, equity) to fund distributions
- Not a high-growth strategy - more focused on value preservation and selective optimization

---

### Strategic Positioning: Value Investing in Transition

**Current Strategic Phase (2025):**

Artis is executing a **portfolio transformation and deleveraging strategy** while attempting to maintain distributions and unit holder value. The REIT is transitioning from a growth/acquisition-oriented model (historical) to a harvest/repositioning model (current) with the following characteristics:

**What Success Looks Like (Management's Implied Targets):**
1. Asset sales of $100-200M annually at or above book value
2. Debt reduction of $75-150M annually, bringing Debt/Assets to 48-50% range
3. Occupancy improvement to 90%+ through committed lease conversions
4. Same-property NOI growth sustained at 2-4% annually
5. Distribution maintained at $0.12-0.15/unit through transition
6. Portfolio concentration in highest-returning assets/markets

**Execution Risks:**
1. **Market Timing Risk:** Commercial real estate transaction volumes weak (particularly office)
2. **Pricing Risk:** May need to sell below book value if liquidity needs become acute
3. **Distribution Policy Risk:** 187.5% payout unsustainable if asset sales stall
4. **Tenant Risk:** Occupancy/renewal challenges in office and retail portfolios
5. **Refinancing Risk:** Weak coverage (1.81x) limits negotiating power on debt rollovers

**Credit Opinion on Strategy:**
- **Directionally Correct:** Deleveraging and portfolio optimization are appropriate given leverage and coverage metrics
- **Execution Concerns:** Modest progress to date (one $4.75M sale in Q2 2025) suggests slow execution pace
- **Distribution Policy Conflict:** Maintaining distributions at 187.5% AFFO payout contradicts balance sheet strengthening goals
- **Timeframe Risk:** Strategy may require 24-36 months to materially improve credit metrics, but weak coverage provides limited time cushion

**Recommended Strategic Shift (Credit Perspective):**
To achieve Ba1/BB+ rating and positive credit momentum, Artis should consider:
1. **Distribution cut to $0.10-0.12/unit** (reduce AFFO payout to 125-150%)
2. **Accelerate asset sales to $200-250M over next 12 months**
3. **Deploy 100% of asset sale proceeds to debt reduction** (suspend NCIB)
4. **Target Debt/Assets of 45-47% within 18-24 months**
5. **Refinance high-cost debt opportunistically** to reduce interest expense

This strategic reset would signal credible commitment to balance sheet repair and support rating upgrade trajectory.

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** No

{{#if BURN_RATE_APPLICABLE}}

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves when AFCF cannot cover financing obligations. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover debt service + distributions.

**Formula:** Burn Rate = Net Financing Needs - AFCF (when AFCF < Net Financing Needs)

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case (50-60% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of $100-150M over next 12 months at 95-105% of IFRS book value
- Occupancy improves to 89-90% as committed leases convert and modest new leasing activity
- Same-property NOI growth sustained at 2-3% annually
- Distribution maintained at $0.15/unit ($14.9M annually) through asset sale proceeds
- No major tenant defaults or market disruptions

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**

Starting Point (Q2 2025):
- Total Debt: $1,369.6M
- Gross Assets: $2,611.4M
- Debt/Assets: 52.5%
- NOI (annualized): $122.9M
- Interest Expense (annualized): $67.7M
- Coverage: 1.81x

Asset Sale Impact ($125M at book value):
- Asset sales: $125M
- Debt paydown: $95M (76% of proceeds)
- Distributions funded: $15M (12% of proceeds)
- Transaction costs: $15M (12% of proceeds)

**Pro Forma Balance Sheet:**
- Total Debt: $1,274.6M (down $95M)
- Gross Assets: $2,486.4M (down $125M)
- **Debt/Assets: 51.3%** (improvement of 120 bps)

**Pro Forma Coverage (assumes stable NOI):**
- Interest Expense: $63.0M (assuming $95M debt at 4.9% rate = -$4.7M interest)
- NOI: $120.0M (slight decline due to asset sales, offset by occupancy gains)
- **Coverage: 1.90x** (improvement of 9 bps)

**Pro Forma Payout Ratios:**
- AFFO: $7.5M (decline from $8.2M due to smaller portfolio)
- Distributions: $14.9M
- **AFFO Payout: 198.7%** (deterioration of 11 percentage points)

**Rating Impact: STABLE at Ba2/BB**

**Rationale:** Modest deleveraging progress (Debt/Assets improves 120 bps, coverage improves to 1.90x) demonstrates execution on asset sale strategy, but AFFO payout deterioration signals unsustainable trajectory. Rating maintained at Ba2 with Negative outlook due to continued distribution policy concerns. Base case represents "muddle through" scenario - not improving fast enough to avoid eventual distribution cut, but not deteriorating rapidly enough to trigger downgrade.

---

### Upside Case (20-30% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of $250-300M over next 12 months at 105-110% of IFRS book value (premium sales)
- Occupancy reaches 91-92% through successful lease-ups and tenant demand improvement
- Same-property NOI growth accelerates to 3.5-4.5% on strong leasing spreads
- Distribution cut to $0.10-0.12/unit (33-20% reduction) to sustainable 120-140% AFFO payout
- Successful refinancing of maturing debt at flat to -25 bps vs. current rates

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**

Asset Sale Impact ($275M at 107.5% of book value):
- Asset sale proceeds: $275M (book value) + $19M (premium) = $294M total
- Debt paydown: $225M (77% of proceeds)
- Distributions/operations: $50M
- Transaction costs: $19M

**Pro Forma Balance Sheet:**
- Total Debt: $1,144.6M (down $225M)
- Gross Assets: $2,336.4M (down $275M)
- **Debt/Assets: 49.0%** (improvement of 350 bps - approaching Baa threshold of 45%)

**Pro Forma Coverage:**
- Interest Expense: $56.6M (debt reduction saves $11.1M annually)
- NOI: $123.5M (modest decline from asset sales offset by 4% same-property growth on remaining portfolio)
- **Coverage: 2.18x** (improvement of 37 bps - entering Ba category midpoint)

**Pro Forma Payout Ratios:**
- AFFO: $9.8M (improved from better portfolio quality and lower interest)
- Distributions: $11.9M (cut to $0.12/unit)
- **AFFO Payout: 121.4%** (improvement of 66 percentage points - approaching sustainability)

**Rating Impact: UPGRADE to Ba1/BB+**

**Rationale:** Combination of (1) meaningful deleveraging (Debt/Assets 49%, approaching Baa threshold), (2) improved coverage (2.18x, solidly Ba), (3) disciplined distribution policy (121% payout, trajectory toward 100%), and (4) demonstrated asset monetization capability (premium sales) supports one-notch upgrade to Ba1. Outlook would be Stable with positive momentum toward Baa3 if sustained for 12-18 months.

**Upgrade Drivers:**
- Distribution cut signals management prioritization of balance sheet strength over yield
- Premium asset sales prove portfolio quality exceeds book values
- Deleveraging trajectory credible (on pace for 45% Debt/Assets within 24 months)
- Coverage approaching 2.5x threshold for investment grade consideration

---

### Downside Case (10-20% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales stall at $30-50M over next 12 months at 85-90% of book value (distressed sales)
- Occupancy declines to 85-86% due to tenant non-renewals and weak leasing demand
- Same-property NOI contracts -1% to 0% on rent concessions and vacancy losses
- Distribution maintained at $0.15/unit, forcing $20-30M equity issuance at 15-20% discount to NAV
- Refinancing of maturing debt at +50-100 bps vs. current rates due to credit concerns

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**

Asset Sale Impact ($40M at 87.5% of book value):
- Asset sale proceeds: $35M (87.5% of $40M book value)
- Book value write-down: $5M (12.5% loss)
- Debt paydown: $20M (57% of proceeds)
- Distributions/operations: $15M

Equity Issuance Impact:
- Equity raised: $25M at 17.5% discount to NAV
- Units issued: ~3.0M units (dilution of ~3%)
- Use of proceeds: Fund distributions ($15M) and operations ($10M)

**Pro Forma Balance Sheet:**
- Total Debt: $1,349.6M (down $20M only)
- Gross Assets: $2,571.4M (down $40M assets sold, down $5M write-down, up $25M equity)
- **Debt/Assets: 52.5%** (no improvement - equity offsets asset sales)

**Pro Forma Coverage:**
- Interest Expense: $70.2M (slight increase from higher refinancing rates on $200M rollover)
- NOI: $117.5M (decline from asset sales and -0.5% same-property NOI)
- **Coverage: 1.67x** (deterioration of 14 bps)

**Pro Forma Payout Ratios:**
- AFFO: $6.5M (decline from weaker operations and higher interest)
- Distributions: $15.3M (slightly higher from diluted unit count)
- **AFFO Payout: 235.4%** (deterioration of 48 percentage points)

**Rating Impact: DOWNGRADE to Ba3/BB-**

**Rationale:** Combination of (1) failed deleveraging (Debt/Assets flat), (2) weakening coverage (1.67x, approaching B threshold), (3) unsustainable payout (235%), and (4) forced equity dilution at distressed valuations signals deteriorating credit profile. Downgrade to Ba3 reflects heightened refinancing risk and increased probability of distribution suspension within 6-12 months.

**Downgrade Drivers:**
- Below-book asset sales indicate portfolio quality concerns
- Equity issuance at discount signals market concerns about NAV and financial sustainability
- Coverage approaching 1.5x leaves minimal cushion for further deterioration
- AFFO payout >200% mathematically unsustainable, distribution cut imminent

**Outlook:** Negative - further downgrade to B1/B+ likely within 6-12 months if distribution not cut or asset sales don't accelerate.

---

### Stress Case (5-10% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Recession scenario: Economic downturn drives -10% to -15% NOI decline across portfolio
- Asset sales freeze entirely (no transactions for 12+ months due to market illiquidity)
- Major tenant default: 150,000-200,000 SF tenant bankruptcy (1.5-2.1% of portfolio)
- Occupancy falls to 82-84% on non-renewals and tenant contractions
- Unable to refinance $300-400M of maturing debt, forcing extension at covenant-tightening terms
- Distribution suspended to preserve liquidity

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**

Operating Impact:
- NOI decline: -12.5% (combination of occupancy loss, rent concessions, tenant default)
- NOI: $107.3M (down from $122.9M)

Financing Impact:
- Debt maturity extensions: $350M extended at +150 bps spread, stricter covenants
- Interest expense: $74.5M (up $6.8M from rate increases)

Liquidity Impact:
- Distributions suspended: $0 payout (saves $15M annually)
- Asset sales: $0 (no market liquidity)
- Liquidity sources: Cash + undrawn credit facilities (assume $100-150M available)

**Pro Forma Balance Sheet:**
- Total Debt: $1,369.6M (unchanged - no asset sales to fund paydown)
- Gross Assets: $2,350.0M (down ~$260M from fair value write-downs)
- **Debt/Assets: 58.3%** (deterioration of 5.8 points - exceeds Ba threshold, enters B category)

**Pro Forma Coverage:**
- Interest Expense: $74.5M
- NOI: $107.3M
- **Coverage: 1.44x** (deterioration of 37 bps - solidly B category <1.5x)

**Pro Forma Payout Ratios:**
- AFFO: $3.8M (severe decline from NOI contraction and higher interest)
- Distributions: $0 (suspended)
- **AFFO Payout: 0%** (suspension)

**Rating Impact: MULTI-NOTCH DOWNGRADE to B1/B+**

**Rationale:** Severe operating deterioration (NOI -12.5%, coverage 1.44x), inability to access asset sale or refinancing markets, and covenant pressure justify multi-notch downgrade to B1. Debt/Assets of 58% exceeds Ba threshold (55%), and coverage below 1.5x signals heightened default risk. Distribution suspension is credit-positive (preserves liquidity) but signals distress.

**Key Risks in Stress Case:**
1. **Covenant breach risk:** Debt/Assets likely has 60-65% covenant → Current 58% leaves only 2-7 point cushion
2. **Liquidity crisis:** Unable to refinance maturing debt may force asset sales at fire-sale prices (60-80% of book value)
3. **Going concern questions:** If recession persists 18+ months and asset sales remain frozen, REIT may face strategic alternatives (merger, recapitalization, liquidation)

**Outlook:** Negative - further downgrade to B2/B possible if liquidity deteriorates or covenant breaches occur.

### Downgrade Trigger Summary

**Key Metric Thresholds and Cushions:**

| Trigger | Downgrade Threshold | Current Level | Buffer | Scenario Risk |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|---------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | >55% (Ba→B) | 52.5% | 2.5 points (4.8%) | Downside: 52.5% (no buffer), Stress: 58.3% (breach) |
| **Coverage** | <1.5x (Ba→B) | 1.81x | 0.31x (17.1%) | Downside: 1.67x (11% buffer), Stress: 1.44x (breach) |
| **AFFO Payout** | >250% (unsustainable) | 187.5% | 62.5 points | Downside: 235% (16 point buffer), Stress: N/A (suspended) |
| **Occupancy** | <85% (distressed) | 87.8% | 2.8 points (3.2%) | Downside: 85-86% (at threshold), Stress: 82-84% (breach) |
| **Liquidity** | <$50M available | ~$100-150M (est.) | $50-100M | Stress: Potential covenant restrictions limit access |

**Near-Term Monitoring Priorities (Next 6-12 Months):**

1. **Q3/Q4 2025 asset sale volumes:** Track progress toward $100M+ annual target
2. **Distribution policy announcements:** Any cut/suspension signals distress but improves credit
3. **Debt maturity schedule:** Identify refinancing needs in 2025-2026 and refinancing terms achieved
4. **Occupancy trends:** Monitor if committed leases convert to occupied (target: 89%+ by year-end)
5. **Same-property NOI growth:** Watch for deterioration below 2% (signals pricing power loss)

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**
```
FFO = IFRS Net Income
    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```
