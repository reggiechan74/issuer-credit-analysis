# Credit Opinion: Artis Real Estate Investment Trust

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Reporting Period:** Q2 2025 (Six months ended June 30, 2025)
**Currency:** CAD

---

## Executive Summary

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust is a transitional credit undergoing significant portfolio repositioning through active asset dispositions ($232.7M in properties held for sale). While the REIT demonstrates best-in-class leverage at 24.6% Debt/Gross Assets—well within investment grade territory—this metric is overshadowed by fundamental operational and financial sustainability challenges. The critical credit concerns include: (1) an unsustainable AFFO payout ratio of 176.5%, indicating distributions substantially exceed cash flow generation; (2) tight NOI/Interest coverage of 1.8x, leaving minimal cushion for operational stress; (3) portfolio execution risk with 82 properties undergoing strategic rationalization; and (4) office sector exposure (55% of GLA) facing structural headwinds with 82.2% occupancy.

The rating reflects a credit in transition: extraordinary leverage discipline supports downside protection, but cash flow sustainability and strategic execution risks prevent an investment grade assessment. The REIT's ability to complete asset sales at acceptable values, redeploy proceeds to reduce debt or improve cash flow, and stabilize distributions will determine the trajectory toward either investment grade restoration or further deterioration.

## Credit Strengths

1. **Best-in-Class Leverage Profile (24.6% Debt/Assets)**
   With total debt of $641.4M against gross assets of $2.61B, Artis maintains Debt/Gross Assets of 24.6%—significantly below the Baa benchmark of 35-45% and approaching Aa-level leverage (<25%). This positions the REIT in the top decile of Canadian REITs for balance sheet conservatism and provides substantial downside protection in stressed scenarios.

2. **Diversified Geographic Footprint (55 Canadian + 27 U.S. Properties)**
   Portfolio spans 9.5M SF across two countries, reducing concentration risk from single-market downturns. U.S. properties represent 52.7% of GLA, providing exposure to deeper capital markets and diversified economic drivers beyond Canadian office market headwinds.

3. **High-Quality Industrial Portfolio (97.3% Occupancy, 3.3M SF)**
   The 36-property industrial segment demonstrates strong fundamentals with near-full occupancy of 97.3%, benefiting from structural tailwinds in logistics and e-commerce. This provides a stable NOI anchor while office properties undergo repositioning.

4. **Active Portfolio Management and Strategic Flexibility**
   Properties held for sale of $232.7M (8.9% of gross assets) demonstrate management's willingness to rationalize the portfolio and crystallize value. Successful dispositions could fund debt reduction, distribution sustainability, or higher-return reinvestment.

5. **100% Mortgage Debt (Zero Unsecured Debentures)**
   All debt is secured mortgage financing ($641.4M) following full repayment of senior unsecured debentures in Q1 2025. This simplifies the capital structure and eliminates covenant-intensive unsecured facilities, though it reduces financial flexibility compared to REITs with unsecured credit facilities.

---

---

## Credit Challenges

1. **Unsustainable Distribution Policy (AFFO Payout Ratio 176.5%)**
   Distributions of $0.30 per unit semi-annually ($0.60 annualized) far exceed AFFO of $0.17 per unit, resulting in a payout ratio of 176.5%. This is untenable and signals either: (a) imminent distribution cuts, (b) asset sale proceeds funding distributions (non-recurring), or (c) deteriorating unit value. Sustainable payout ratios typically range 80-95% of AFFO for growth REITs and up to 100% for harvest-mode REITs.

2. **Tight Interest Coverage (1.8x NOI/Interest)**
   With NOI of $61.9M (six months) and annualized interest expense of $68.7M, coverage sits at 1.8x—below the Ba threshold of 2.0x and well short of investment grade benchmarks (Baa: 3.0-4.0x). This leaves minimal cushion for occupancy declines, lease rollovers at lower rates, or rising interest costs on variable-rate debt refinancings.

3. **Office Portfolio Headwinds (82.2% Occupancy, 5.3M SF)**
   Office properties represent 55% of GLA but face structural challenges: 82.2% occupancy (vs. 97.3% for industrial), hybrid work pressures, and tenant flight to newer Class A buildings. Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% is positive but may not persist if leasing spreads compress or vacancies rise.

4. **Concentrated Debt Maturity Risk (66% Due Within 12 Months)**
   Current portion of debt totals $423.5M (66% of total debt) maturing within one year. While properties held for sale can fund repayments, refinancing at current rates (6.71% weighted average effective rate) could compress coverage further. The REIT's ability to execute asset sales at or above book value is critical to avoiding refinancing stress.

---

---

## Rating Outlook

The Negative outlook reflects elevated refinancing and distribution sustainability risks over the next 12-18 months. Key determinants include:

1. **Asset Disposition Execution:** Successful sale of $232.7M in held-for-sale properties at or above book value is essential to reduce the $423.5M debt maturity wall. Failure to execute or sales below carrying value would pressure coverage and potentially trigger distribution cuts.

2. **Distribution Policy Adjustment:** The 176.5% AFFO payout ratio is unsustainable. Management must either: (a) reduce distributions to 80-95% of AFFO (~$0.14-$0.16 per unit vs. current $0.30), or (b) meaningfully grow AFFO through portfolio optimization. Continued reliance on asset sales to fund distributions erodes equity value.

3. **Interest Rate Environment:** With 73.8% of debt in variable or swapped structures and significant near-term maturities, refinancing risk is elevated. If interest rates remain elevated or rise further, coverage could deteriorate below 1.5x, triggering downgrade pressure.

4. **Office Market Stabilization:** Occupancy in the office portfolio (82.2%) must stabilize or improve. Further declines below 80% would impair NOI generation and exacerbate coverage tightness.

**Outlook could be revised to Stable if:**
- Asset sales of $200M+ completed at book value or better by Q1 2026
- Distributions reduced to 90-100% of AFFO (~$0.15-$0.17 per unit)
- Interest coverage improves to >2.0x through NOI growth or debt reduction

---

---

## Upgrade Factors

**Upgrade to Baa3/BBB- (Investment Grade) would require:**

1. **Coverage Improvement to >2.5x**
   NOI/Interest coverage must sustainably exceed 2.5x, requiring either: (a) NOI growth of 40%+ to $87M annualized, or (b) debt reduction to ~$500M (from $641M), or (c) combination of both. This is achievable through successful asset sales and proceeds deployed to debt paydown.

2. **AFFO Payout Ratio Reduced to 80-90%**
   Distributions must be rightsized to $0.14-$0.15 per unit (from $0.30), demonstrating financial discipline and sustainable cash flow generation. This would also require AFFO stabilization or growth to $0.17-$0.19 per unit.

3. **Debt/Assets Maintained <30%**
   Leverage must remain below 30% through asset sale discipline and debt reduction priority. This is already achieved (24.6%) but must be sustained through the disposition cycle.

4. **Portfolio Stabilization (Occupancy >88%)**
   Combined portfolio occupancy (currently 87.8%) must improve to >88% with office segment reaching 85%+ occupancy. This would signal successful leasing execution and market acceptance of the portfolio.

5. **Refinancing Risk Mitigation**
   Debt maturity profile extended with <30% maturing in any 12-month period. This requires proactive refinancing or use of asset sale proceeds to eliminate near-term maturities ($423.5M current portion).

**Timeframe:** 18-24 months, contingent on successful execution of asset sales ($200M+) and distribution policy reset.

---

---

## Downgrade Factors

**Downgrade to Ba3/BB- or lower would occur if:**

1. **Interest Coverage Falls Below 1.5x**
   Further deterioration in NOI (from occupancy declines or lease rollovers) or rising interest costs could push coverage below 1.5x, indicating distressed credit characteristics. This threshold represents approximately 15% NOI decline from current levels or 20% increase in interest expense.

2. **Asset Sales Below Book Value (>10% Discount)**
   If properties held for sale ($232.7M) are sold at significant discounts (>10% below carrying value), it would signal asset quality concerns and impair equity. Example: Sales at $210M would create $23M loss, reducing equity to $1.45B and Debt/Assets to 25.9%.

3. **Distribution Cut Without Corresponding Deleveraging**
   If distributions are reduced but proceeds are not directed to debt reduction or value-accretive reinvestment, it signals fundamental cash flow deterioration without strategic remediation. This would undermine unitholder confidence and credit quality simultaneously.

4. **Occupancy Decline Below 85%**
   Portfolio occupancy falling below 85% (from 87.8%) would indicate accelerating tenant departures and leasing market weakness. This would directly impair NOI and coverage, potentially triggering a covenant breach or liquidity stress.

5. **Covenant Breach or Liquidity Crisis**
   Inability to refinance maturing debt ($423.5M) due to lender concerns, covenant violations, or market dislocation would constitute a material credit event. This could force asset liquidation at distressed pricing.

6. **Leverage Increases Above 35% Debt/Assets**
   While currently at 24.6%, adverse scenarios (asset impairments, debt-funded distributions, or failed asset sales) could push leverage toward 35%, eliminating the primary credit strength and aligning Artis with distressed peers.

**Trigger Scenarios:**
- **Recession scenario:** 15% EBITDA decline + refinancing stress → Coverage to 1.4x, potential downgrade to B+/B1
- **Failed asset sales:** Unable to sell held-for-sale properties, forcing rollover of $423.5M maturities at 8%+ rates → Coverage to 1.5x
- **Distribution maintenance:** Continued $0.60/unit distributions funded by asset sales → Equity erosion to $1.3B, Debt/Assets to 33%

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Gross Assets: $2.61B | **Baa** | Falls within $2-5B range (Baa category). Moderate scale provides diversification benefits but lacks market dominance of >$10B peers. 82 properties across 9.5M SF demonstrates meaningful portfolio breadth. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Mixed quality, transitional portfolio | **Ba** | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Ba2 - Mixed portfolio with strong industrial (97.3% occupancy) offset by challenged office (82.2% occupancy). Geographic diversification (55% Canada, 45% U.S.) is positive, but properties held for sale ($232.7M) signal repositioning needs. <br><br>**Market Characteristics (12.5%):** Ba2 - Office exposure (55% of GLA) faces structural headwinds; industrial benefits from secular tailwinds. Markets include secondary/tertiary locations vulnerable to economic cycles. Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% is modest. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Constrained, transition-dependent | **Ba** | Limited access given: (1) equity trading below NAV (implied by harvest-mode distribution policy), (2) all debt is secured mortgages (no unsecured revolver flexibility), (3) $423.5M debt maturing within 12 months requiring asset sale execution or refinancing in challenging rate environment. Successful asset sales would improve this factor; failed execution would deteriorate it to B category. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Exceptional leverage, weak coverage | **Ba/Baa Split** | **Debt/Gross Assets: 24.6%** → **Aaa/Aa territory** (<25% benchmark)<br><br>**NOI/Interest Coverage: 1.8x** → **Below Ba threshold** (Ba: 2.0-3.0x; actual: 1.8x)<br><br>**Weighted Assessment:** Coverage weakness dominates despite exceptional leverage. The 1.8x coverage leaves minimal cushion and reflects fundamental cash flow stress. **Overall Factor Score: Ba2** |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | Aggressive/Harvest Mode | **Ba** | AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% indicates highly aggressive financial policy prioritizing distributions over sustainability. This is characteristic of harvest-mode REITs liquidating portfolios or distressed credits unable to reset distributions. Either scenario reflects Ba-level financial discipline. Lack of equity issuance capacity and reliance on asset sales for liquidity further supports Ba assessment. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Weighted Average** | **Ba2** | **Indicated Rating: Ba2 / BB (Speculative Grade)**<br><br>**Factor Weighting Calculation:**<br>- Scale (5%): Baa = 7 → 0.35<br>- Business (25%): Ba = 5 → 1.25<br>- Capital Access (20%): Ba = 5 → 1.00<br>- Leverage/Coverage (35%): Ba = 5 → 1.75<br>- Financial Policy (15%): Ba = 5 → 0.75<br>**Total Weighted Score: 5.10 → Ba2**<br><br>The scorecard outcome of Ba2 reflects a credit with investment-grade leverage characteristics (24.6% Debt/Assets) overwhelmed by speculative-grade operational and financial policy risks. The REIT's transition strategy—successful asset sales, debt reduction, and distribution reset—could drive upgrade to Ba1/Baa3 over 12-18 months. Conversely, execution failure or coverage deterioration could trigger downgrade to Ba3/B1. |

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**FFO Metrics (Six Months Ended June 30, 2025):**
- **FFO:** $34.5M ($0.34 per unit diluted)
- **FFO Payout Ratio:** 88.2% (semi-annual distribution $0.30 / FFO per unit $0.34)
- **Assessment:** FFO payout at 88.2% appears sustainable and aligns with REIT industry norms (80-95%). However, this metric is misleading as it excludes maintenance capital expenditures.

**AFFO Metrics (The Critical Sustainability Test):**
- **AFFO:** $16.9M ($0.17 per unit diluted)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 176.5% (semi-annual distribution $0.30 / AFFO per unit $0.17)
- **Assessment:** **AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is the single most important credit metric.** This indicates the REIT is distributing $1.77 for every $1.00 of sustainable cash flow generated. The shortfall of $0.13 per unit ($13M annualized) is being funded by: (a) asset sales (non-recurring), (b) drawing down cash reserves, or (c) issuing equity at dilutive pricing. This is unsustainable beyond 2-3 quarters absent corrective action.

**Reconciliation of FFO to AFFO:**
- FFO: $34.5M
- Less: Maintenance capex and leasing costs (estimated): ~$17.5M
- **AFFO: $16.9M**
- **The $17.5M adjustment represents 51% of FFO, highlighting capital intensity of maintaining the portfolio.**

### Portfolio Quality Assessment

**Occupancy Dynamics:**
- **Overall Occupancy:** 87.8% (89.0% including commitments)
- **Industrial Segment:** 97.3% (excellent, top-quartile performance)
- **Office Segment:** 82.2% (below market, distressed)
- **Retail Segment:** 85.9% (stable but challenged)

**Assessment:** The 200 bps gap between in-place (87.8%) and committed (89.0%) occupancy provides modest near-term visibility, but the office segment's 82.2% occupancy is a structural concern. Office leases rolling over in 2025-2026 face potential negative spreads given market softness.

**Same-Property NOI Growth:**
- **Six Months Ended June 30, 2025:** +2.3% YoY
- **Assessment:** Positive growth is encouraging but modest. For context, industrial REITs are achieving 4-6% same-property NOI growth in current environment, while office REITs are experiencing flat to negative growth. The 2.3% blended figure suggests industrial strength is being offset by office weakness.

### Interest Rate and Debt Structure

**Weighted Average Effective Rate:** 6.71%
**Weighted Average Nominal Rate:** 6.21%
**Spread (Effective - Nominal):** 50 bps (reflects amortization of deferred financing costs)

**Rate Structure:**
- **Fixed Rate:** 26.2% of debt
- **Variable with Swaps:** 31.5% of debt
- **Implied Variable (Unswapped):** 42.3% of debt

**Assessment:** With only 26.2% of debt in fixed-rate structures, the REIT has significant exposure to interest rate volatility. The 42.3% unswapped variable-rate debt is particularly concerning given $423.5M (66%) maturing within 12 months. Refinancing at current rates (or higher) would compress coverage below 1.5x.

**Refinancing Stress Test:**
- **Scenario:** Refinance $423.5M at 7.5% (vs. current blended 6.71%)
- **Impact:** Interest expense increases by $3.4M annually
- **Pro Forma Coverage:** 1.7x (from 1.8x) → approaching distressed territory

### Properties Held for Sale

**Carrying Value:** $232.7M (8.9% of gross assets)
**Strategic Importance:** Critical to addressing $423.5M debt maturities

**Scenarios:**

1. **Base Case (Sale at Book Value):**
   - Proceeds: $232.7M
   - Use: Repay debt, reducing total debt to $408.7M
   - Pro Forma Debt/Assets: 19.1% (from 24.6%) → exceptional
   - Pro Forma Coverage: 2.4x (from 1.8x) → approaching Baa level
   - **Rating Impact:** Positive, supports upgrade to Ba1 if distribution policy also reset

2. **Downside Case (Sale at 15% Discount):**
   - Proceeds: $197.8M
   - Loss: $34.9M (reduces equity to $1.44B)
   - Debt repayment: $197.8M, residual debt: $443.6M
   - Pro Forma Debt/Assets: 26.2% (from 24.6%) → still strong
   - Pro Forma Coverage: 1.9x (from 1.8x) → marginal improvement
   - **Rating Impact:** Negative, signals asset quality concerns, supports downgrade to Ba3

3. **Stress Case (Unable to Sell, Forced Refinancing):**
   - Refinance $423.5M at 8.0% (distressed pricing)
   - Interest expense increases by $5.5M annually
   - Pro Forma Coverage: 1.6x → distressed
   - **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to B+ / B1, outlook negative

### Cash Position and Liquidity

**Cash on Hand:** $16.6M
**Cash Held in Trust:** $6.2M
**Total Liquidity:** $22.8M

**Assessment:** Liquidity of $22.8M is minimal relative to $423.5M near-term debt maturities (5.4% coverage). The REIT is fully dependent on asset sale execution or refinancing capacity. There is no disclosed credit facility or unsecured revolver providing backstop liquidity. This heightens refinancing risk and supports Ba-level capital access assessment.

**Liquidity Coverage Ratios:**
- Cash / Current Debt Maturities: 5.4% (distressed)
- Cash / Quarterly Interest Expense: 66% (1 quarter coverage only)
- **Conclusion:** Liquidity is a material credit weakness.

## Appendix A: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```
