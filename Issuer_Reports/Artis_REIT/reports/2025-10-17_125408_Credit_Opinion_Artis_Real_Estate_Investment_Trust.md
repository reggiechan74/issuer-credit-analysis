## Appendix A: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```
