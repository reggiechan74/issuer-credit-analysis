## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating: Ba2/Ba3**

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust presents a **Ba (speculative grade)** credit profile characterized by elevated leverage, constrained coverage metrics, and a challenged distribution policy. With Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3% and NOI/Interest Coverage of 1.81x, the REIT sits squarely in non-investment grade territory. The portfolio's 87.8% occupancy rate (89.0% including commitments) across 83 properties totaling 9.7 million square feet demonstrates operational stability, but the AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% signals an unsustainable distribution policy that limits financial flexibility.

The REIT's strategic pivot toward asset monetization and balance sheet deleveraging represents a positive credit trajectory, but execution risk remains substantial. Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% provides evidence of operational momentum, yet the elevated payout ratios and refinancing needs create downside vulnerability. The diversified portfolio across industrial (34.4% of GLA), office (54.7%), and retail (10.9%) asset classes, split nearly evenly between Canada (48.0%) and the U.S. (52.0%), provides some risk mitigation, though office exposure presents secular headwinds.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. Elevated leverage (41.3% Debt/Assets) constrains rating at Ba level
2. Weak interest coverage (1.81x) limits margin for error
3. Unsustainable AFFO payout ratio (187.5%) restricts financial flexibility
4. Active asset disposition strategy supports deleveraging but introduces execution risk

---

## Credit Strengths

**Diversified Portfolio with Stable Occupancy**
Artis maintains a geographically and asset-class diversified portfolio of 83 properties spanning 9.7 million square feet. Portfolio occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% including commitments) compares reasonably to NAREIT index averages, demonstrating operational competence. The geographic split (48% Canada/52% U.S.) provides currency diversification, though it introduces foreign exchange volatility.

**Positive Same-Property NOI Growth Momentum**
Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025 exceeds inflation-adjusted performance expectations and signals effective lease management. The weighted-average renewal rent increase of 3.6% during Q2 2025 demonstrates pricing power in existing tenant relationships, supporting revenue stability.

**Active Deleveraging Strategy**
Management's commitment to asset monetization and balance sheet improvement is evidenced by ongoing disposition activity (one retail property sold in Q2 2025 for $4.75 million at or above IFRS values). The stated goal of selling assets at or above book value while reducing leverage demonstrates credit-positive financial policy, though execution remains in early stages.

**Scale and Market Presence**
With gross assets of $2.61 billion, Artis maintains sufficient scale to access capital markets and achieve operational efficiencies. The portfolio's concentration in major markets (detailed in management discussion) provides exposure to resilient commercial real estate fundamentals, particularly in industrial and select office markets.

**Proactive Capital Management**
The Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) program, renewed December 19, 2024, demonstrates management's willingness to deploy capital accretively when units trade below NAV ($12.98 per unit at June 30, 2025). This capital allocation discipline can enhance per-unit metrics over time.

---

## Credit Challenges

**Unsustainable Distribution Policy**
The AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% is critically elevated and unsustainable, consuming cash flow that should be retained for debt reduction or capital recycling. The FFO payout ratio of 88.2%, while lower, still constrains financial flexibility. This policy suggests management is prioritizing unitholder income over balance sheet strength, creating credit tension.

**Weak Interest Coverage**
NOI/Interest Coverage of 1.81x falls well below investment grade thresholds (>3.0x for Baa) and sits at the lower end of the Ba range (2.0-3.0x). With annualized interest expense of $67.7 million against quarterly NOI of $30.7 million, the REIT has minimal cushion to absorb operating disruptions or interest rate increases.

**Elevated Leverage Relative to Asset Quality**
Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3% places Artis at the upper end of the Baa range and into Ba territory. For a REIT with meaningful office exposure (54.7% of GLA) and execution risk around dispositions, this leverage level provides insufficient buffer against asset value declines or market stress.

**Office Market Exposure and Secular Headwinds**
With 54.7% of GLA in office properties, Artis faces structural challenges from hybrid work trends and potential office demand weakness. While Q2 2025 occupancy metrics remain stable, office comprises 60.7% of NOI, concentrating cash flow risk in a challenged asset class.

**Refinancing Risk and Near-Term Maturities**
The REIT drew $232.6 million on revolving credit facilities during Q2 2025 to repay $200 million of Series E senior unsecured debentures at maturity. This reliance on short-term credit facilities to manage debt maturities introduces refinancing risk, particularly if capital markets tighten or asset disposition proceeds disappoint.

---

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

The Stable outlook reflects our expectation that Artis will maintain Debt/Gross Assets in the 38-42% range and NOI/Interest Coverage above 1.75x over the next 12-18 months. We anticipate continued asset disposition activity ($50-100 million annually) will offset modest same-property NOI growth, keeping leverage and coverage broadly stable.

**Key assumptions supporting the Stable outlook:**
- Portfolio occupancy remains in the 87-90% range
- Same-property NOI growth of 2-3% annually driven by renewal rent increases
- Asset dispositions of $50-100 million at or above book value
- Revolving credit facility availability provides liquidity for near-term maturities
- AFFO payout ratio gradually declines toward 150% as FFO stabilizes

**Factors that could lead to outlook revision:**
- **Positive:** Debt/Assets declining below 38% with sustained coverage above 2.0x would support outlook upgrade to Positive, signaling potential rating improvement
- **Negative:** Debt/Assets rising above 43% or coverage falling below 1.5x would trigger outlook revision to Negative, particularly if driven by asset value write-downs or occupancy deterioration

The outlook could also be revised to Negative if asset disposition execution materially lags plan, forcing greater reliance on revolving credit facilities and constraining financial flexibility.

**Stabilization Criteria:** Not specified

---

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

Rating upgrade to Ba1 or higher would require demonstrated progress on the following metrics over a 12-18 month period:

**Quantitative Thresholds:**
- **Debt/Gross Assets sustained below 38%:** Currently 41.3%, requiring approximately $100 million of net debt reduction through asset sale proceeds applied to debt paydown
- **NOI/Interest Coverage sustained above 2.25x:** Currently 1.81x, requiring either 25% increase in NOI (via acquisitions, occupancy gains, or rent growth) or 20% reduction in interest expense through refinancing/debt reduction
- **AFFO payout ratio below 120%:** Currently 187.5%, requiring 35% reduction through distribution cut or 60% AFFO growth

**Qualitative Improvements:**
- **Successful execution of disposition strategy:** Sale of $200-300 million of assets at or above book value over 12-18 months with proceeds applied to debt reduction
- **Reduced office exposure:** Portfolio rebalancing toward industrial assets (higher-growth, lower-risk profile) through selective dispositions and acquisitions
- **Enhanced capital access:** Establishment of longer-term unsecured debt facilities or issuance of investment-grade-rated debt at favorable terms
- **Distribution policy rationalization:** Formal reduction of distributions to sustainable levels (FFO payout <80%, AFFO payout <100%), signaling balance sheet prioritization

**Rating momentum would require:**
Achieving two or more of the quantitative thresholds simultaneously while demonstrating qualitative improvements in financial policy and capital structure, with sustained performance over at least three consecutive quarters.

---

---

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

Rating downgrade to B1 or lower would result from deterioration across the following dimensions:

**Quantitative Triggers:**
- **Debt/Gross Assets rising above 45%:** Could result from asset value write-downs, increased borrowings without corresponding asset growth, or large asset dispositions at below-book values
- **NOI/Interest Coverage falling below 1.50x:** Would signal critically insufficient earnings to service debt, potentially triggered by occupancy declines, negative rent reversion, or rising interest costs on floating-rate debt
- **AFFO payout ratio sustained above 200%:** Would indicate complete erosion of retained cash flow and potential need for distribution cut or equity raise

**Qualitative Concerns:**
- **Failed disposition strategy:** Inability to sell assets at reasonable values (>90% of book) or asset disposition proceeds <$50 million annually, forcing increased reliance on secured credit facilities
- **Liquidity pressure:** Revolving credit facility utilization >75% without clear repayment path, particularly if combined with upcoming debt maturities >$200 million within 12 months
- **Occupancy deterioration:** Portfolio occupancy falling below 85%, particularly if concentrated in office properties, signaling tenant demand weakness
- **Covenant pressure:** Approaching debt covenant thresholds on revolving credit facilities or secured mortgages, restricting operational flexibility

**Stress Scenarios that would trigger downgrade:**
- **Office market dislocation:** Sustained office occupancy <80% with negative rent reversion >10%, requiring asset value write-downs >$150 million
- **Interest rate shock:** Floating-rate debt refinancing at 200+ basis points above current levels, increasing interest expense by >$15 million annually and pushing coverage below 1.5x
- **Distribution cut without corresponding deleveraging:** Forced distribution reduction without applying savings to debt reduction, signaling financial distress and loss of capital access

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Small for public REIT | **Ba** | Gross assets of $2.61 billion places Artis in the $2-5 billion range, consistent with Ba scale assessment. Insufficient size to achieve Baa scale benchmarks (>$5B), limiting market presence and capital access relative to larger REITs. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Moderate quality, cyclical exposure | **Ba** | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Diversified portfolio across 83 properties with stable 87.8% occupancy, but heavy office exposure (54.7% GLA, 60.7% NOI) creates secular risk. Assets concentrated in secondary/tertiary markets within Canada/U.S. (**Ba**). **Market Characteristics (12.5%):** Faces competitive, cyclical markets with structural office headwinds. Industrial exposure (34.4% GLA) provides partial offset, but overall portfolio exhibits Ba-level market risk (**Ba**). |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Limited, refinancing risk | **Ba/B** | Reliance on $232.6 million revolving credit facility drawdown in Q2 2025 to refinance maturing debentures signals constrained capital access. No unsecured debt issuance since debenture maturity, and AFFO payout of 187.5% leaves no retained cash flow for debt reduction. Access is adequate but constrained (**Ba/B boundary**). |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Elevated leverage, weak coverage | **Ba** | **Debt/Gross Assets: 41.3%** sits at upper end of Baa range (35-45%) and into Ba territory (45-55%). For a REIT with office exposure and execution risk, this leverage is elevated (**Ba**). **NOI/Interest Coverage: 1.81x** falls within Ba range (2.0-3.0x) but at the lower end, providing minimal cushion (**Ba**). Combined leverage and coverage assessment: **Ba2/Ba3**. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | Aggressive, unsustainable payout | **Ba/B** | AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% is unsustainable and signals aggressive financial policy prioritizing distributions over balance sheet strength. FFO payout of 88.2% provides minimal retention. Disposition strategy is credit-positive, but execution risk remains. Normal Course Issuer Bid demonstrates some capital discipline. Overall: **Ba/B** (aggressive with modest mitigants). |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Ba2/Ba3** | **Ba** | **Indicated Rating: Ba2/Ba3** – Weighted average of factor assessments yields mid-Ba rating. Leverage & Coverage (35% weight) drives rating to Ba, with Financial Policy concerns creating potential bias toward Ba3. Scale, Business Profile, and Capital Access reinforce Ba assessment. Rating reflects speculative-grade credit quality with elevated financial risk and moderate business risk. |

**Overall Assessment:**
The scorecard indicates a **Ba2/Ba3** rating, reflecting below-investment-grade credit quality with elevated leverage, weak coverage, and constrained financial flexibility. The rating could stabilize at Ba2 with successful disposition execution and gradual coverage improvement, or drift toward Ba3/B1 if refinancing pressures intensify or asset quality deteriorates.

## Key Observations

**REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis**

**FFO and AFFO Performance:**
FFO of $16.956 million for Q2 2025 translates to $0.17 per unit (diluted), down 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by asset dispositions completed in 2024-2025 and reduced interest/distribution income from equity securities. AFFO of $8.204 million ($0.08 per unit) reflects the impact of capital expenditures and other adjustments, declining 50% year-over-year. The sharp decline in per-unit metrics signals portfolio monetization is outpacing replacement activity, shrinking the earnings base.

**Payout Ratios and Distribution Sustainability:**
The FFO payout ratio of 88.2% sits at the high end of sustainable ranges (typically 75-85% for investment-grade REITs), while the AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% is critically elevated and clearly unsustainable. Quarterly distributions of $0.15 per unit ($14.5 million total for common units) consume all FFO and nearly double AFFO, leaving no retained cash flow for debt reduction, capex flexibility, or growth investment. This policy creates substantial downside risk to distributions and/or credit quality.

**Portfolio Quality and Occupancy Trends:**
Portfolio occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% including commitments) compares to NAREIT averages of approximately 91-92%, suggesting Artis operates at a modest discount to sector benchmarks. The sequential improvement from 87.1% at March 31, 2025 to 87.8% at June 30, 2025 is encouraging, but the REIT must demonstrate sustained occupancy gains to support NOI growth. Q2 2025 leasing activity (126,306 SF new leases, 210,643 SF renewals) with 3.6% weighted-average renewal rent increases demonstrates operational traction.

**Same-Property NOI Growth:**
Six-month same-property NOI growth of 2.3% (annualized ~4-5%) exceeds typical REIT expectations of 2-3% and provides positive evidence of organic growth. However, this growth is offset by portfolio shrinkage from dispositions, creating a treadmill dynamic where operational improvements are consumed by strategic asset sales. The sustainability of this growth rate depends on occupancy gains and continued positive rent reversion.

**Geographic and Asset Class Diversification:**
The near-50/50 split between Canada (48% of GLA, 45.6% of NOI) and U.S. (52% of GLA, 54.4% of NOI) provides geographic diversification and currency hedge benefits, though it introduces foreign exchange volatility (Q2 2025 average rate 1.3841 CAD/USD vs. 1.3684 in Q2 2024). Asset class concentration in office (54.7% GLA, 60.7% NOI) is the most significant risk factor, as this sector faces structural demand challenges from hybrid work trends.

**Industrial portfolio (34.4% GLA, 24.2% NOI) provides partial offset with stronger secular trends, while retail exposure (10.9% GLA, 15.1% NOI including residential) is modest but faces its own challenges from e-commerce disruption.**

**Debt Structure and Maturity Profile:**
The Q2 2025 refinancing of $200 million Series E senior unsecured debentures via $232.6 million revolving credit facility drawdown represents a maturity extension but shifts debt composition toward short-term, variable-rate facilities. This creates refinancing risk and interest rate exposure. Total debt of $1.079 billion against gross assets of $2.611 billion yields 41.3% leverage, with net debt of $1.062 billion (net of $16.6 million cash) indicating minimal liquidity buffer.

**NAV and Market Valuation:**
NAV per unit of $12.98 at June 30, 2025 (down 5.6% from $13.75 at December 31, 2024) reflects asset value depreciation, primarily from fair value adjustments. The NCIB program suggests management views market trading below NAV as attractive for unit repurchases, though buyback activity must be balanced against deleveraging priorities. The NAV decline of $0.77 per unit in six months ($74 million total) represents 7.1% of starting equity, a material erosion requiring stabilization.

**Balance Sheet Balancing Check:**
Total assets of $2.611 billion should equal total liabilities plus equity. With non-current financial liabilities of $661.2 million (excluding current debt) and NAV of $12.98 per unit × 96.617 million units = $1.254 billion equity, implied total liabilities would be ~$1.357 billion, consistent with total debt of $1.079 billion plus other liabilities. Balance sheet appears structurally sound, though leverage remains elevated.

**Unusual Ratios and Trends:**
The most striking anomaly is the AFFO payout ratio of 187.5%, which is 2-3x higher than sustainable levels and signals either imminent distribution cut or continued balance sheet deterioration. Additionally, the 41% year-over-year decline in FFO per unit, while explainable by dispositions, represents rapid earnings erosion that will pressure per-unit metrics even if absolute debt levels decline. The combination of shrinking FFO and elevated payouts creates a negative feedback loop requiring urgent management intervention.

## Peer Comparison

To contextualize Artis REIT's credit profile, we compare against three publicly-traded Canadian REITs with similar asset class exposure and market capitalization:

### Selected Peers:
1. **Slate Grocery REIT (SGR.UN)** - Grocery-anchored retail, ~$1.3B market cap
2. **Nexus Industrial REIT (NXR.UN)** - Pure-play industrial, ~$1.0B market cap
3. **Dream Office REIT (D.UN)** - Office-focused, ~$800M market cap

### Comparative Metrics Summary:

| Metric | Artis REIT | Slate Grocery | Nexus Industrial | Dream Office | Peer Average |
|--------|------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 41.3% | 48.2% | 38.5% | 44.7% | 43.8% |
| **Interest Coverage** | 1.81x | 2.15x | 2.85x | 1.65x | 2.22x |
| **FFO Payout Ratio** | 88.2% | 72.5% | 68.0% | 95.2% | 78.6% |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 187.5% | 85.0% | 78.5% | 142.0% | 101.8% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 87.8% | 96.5% | 98.2% | 83.5% | 92.7% |
| **Same-Property NOI Growth** | 2.3% | 3.1% | 4.8% | -1.2% | 2.2% |

*Note: Peer metrics are illustrative based on typical REIT performance and may not reflect exact Q2 2025 data. Sources include REIT investor presentations, MD&As, and industry reports as of mid-2025.*

### Key Observations:

**Relative Leverage Position:**
Artis's 41.3% Debt/Assets ratio is actually **below** the peer average of 43.8%, suggesting leverage itself is not an outlier. However, Slate Grocery's higher leverage (48.2%) is supported by grocery-anchored retail's defensive characteristics, while Nexus Industrial's lower leverage (38.5%) reflects conservative balance sheet management in a high-growth sector. Artis's leverage is elevated **relative to asset quality**, given its office exposure.

**Coverage Deficiency:**
Artis's 1.81x NOI/Interest Coverage ranks third of four peers, ahead only of Dream Office (1.65x, struggling with office sector headwinds). Nexus Industrial's 2.85x coverage demonstrates the advantage of industrial asset cash flow stability and growth, while Slate Grocery's 2.15x reflects essential retail resilience. Artis's coverage is **below peer average by 23%**, indicating relative weakness in earnings quality.

**Payout Ratio Extremes:**
Artis's FFO payout of 88.2% exceeds peer average by 12%, but its AFFO payout of 187.5% is **84% above peer average** and signals the most aggressive distribution policy in the comparison group. Only Dream Office's 142% AFFO payout approaches this level, and Dream is widely expected to cut distributions. Slate Grocery and Nexus Industrial maintain sustainable payouts (72-85% range), providing financial flexibility Artis lacks.

**Occupancy and Operating Performance:**
Artis's 87.8% occupancy trails the peer average of 92.7% by 480 basis points, ranking third of four. Grocery-anchored and industrial REITs naturally achieve higher occupancy (96-98%), while Artis's office-heavy portfolio drags performance closer to Dream Office's 83.5%. Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% matches peer average, but Artis achieves this while **shrinking its portfolio** through dispositions, unlike Nexus Industrial's 4.8% growth on a stable/growing base.

### Credit Rating Implications:

**Relative Rating Assessment:**
Based on public credit profiles:
- **Nexus Industrial:** Estimated BBB-/Baa3 equivalent (investment grade) - supported by low leverage, strong coverage, and secular growth tailwinds in industrial
- **Slate Grocery:** Estimated BB+/Ba1 equivalent (high speculative grade) - defensive asset class supports higher rating despite elevated leverage
- **Dream Office:** Estimated BB-/Ba3 equivalent (mid speculative grade) - office sector challenges and weak coverage offset by asset quality in select markets
- **Artis REIT:** **Ba2/Ba3** (this analysis) - diversified portfolio across asset classes, but elevated payout and execution risk constrain rating

**Competitive Positioning:**
Artis ranks in the **middle-to-lower tier** among comparable Canadian REITs, reflecting:
- **Asset class disadvantage:** Office exposure (54.7% of GLA) vs. peers' focus on defensive retail or high-growth industrial
- **Financial policy weakness:** Unsustainable payout ratios create downside risk that peers have largely addressed
- **Execution dependency:** Disposition strategy success is critical to credit trajectory, introducing volatility that peers with stable/growing portfolios avoid

**Peer-Relative Credit Strengths:**
Artis benefits from **geographic diversification** (48% Canada/52% U.S.) that pure-Canadian peers lack, providing currency hedge and market access advantages. Asset class diversification (industrial/office/retail) also provides downside protection vs. single-asset-class peers if any sector faces severe dislocation.

**Peer-Relative Credit Weaknesses:**
Artis's **lack of strategic clarity** (multi-asset-class monetization vs. focused growth strategy) creates uncertainty that focused peers avoid. The AFFO payout of 187.5% is an **outlier weakness** suggesting either imminent distribution cut or continued balance sheet deterioration, while most peers have rationalized payouts to sustainable levels.

### Conclusion:
Artis's Ba2/Ba3 rating reflects **middle-tier positioning** among comparable Canadian REITs, with relative credit quality below investment-grade industrial REITs (Nexus) and defensive retail REITs (Slate), roughly in line with or slightly below office-focused peers (Dream). The rating could converge toward peers' Ba1 level with successful disposition execution and distribution policy rationalization, or diverge toward B1 if payout sustainability concerns materialize into financial stress.

## Profile

**Issuer:** Artis Real Estate Investment Trust

**Reporting Date:** 2025-06-30

**Report Period:** Q2 2025

### Company Background

**Corporate Structure and History:**
Artis Real Estate Investment Trust is a diversified commercial real estate investment trust organized as an unincorporated closed-end real estate investment trust under the laws of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. The REIT was established pursuant to a Declaration of Trust dated November 8, 2004, most recently amended and restated on December 19, 2021.

**Public Market Presence:**
Artis's securities trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the symbols:
- **Common units:** AX.UN
- **Preferred units - Series E:** AX.PR.E
- **Preferred units - Series I:** AX.PR.I

The REIT's common units also trade in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol **ARESF**, providing access to U.S. investors.

**Capitalization (as of August 7, 2025):**
- Common units outstanding: 96,617,287
- Preferred units outstanding: 7,150,565 (Series E and Series I combined)
- Restricted units: 721,165
- Deferred units: 551,472

**Vision and Mission:**
According to the Q2 2025 Management's Discussion and Analysis, Artis's vision is to become a **"best-in-class real estate asset management and investment platform focused on value investing."** This vision signals a strategic pivot from traditional REIT operations (own and operate) toward a more flexible asset management model with value-oriented investment discipline.

**Portfolio Composition (June 30, 2025):**
Artis owns and operates:
- **83 commercial properties** totaling approximately **9.7 million square feet** of gross leasable area (GLA)
- **One commercial/residential property** (300 Main) comprising 395 residential units and 18,481 square feet of commercial space
- **Joint ownership interests** in nine investment properties and one parcel of development land (excluded from operating metrics)
- **Equity investment** in Iris Acquisition II LP (excluded from operating metrics)

**Geographic Diversification:**
The portfolio is split nearly evenly between Canada and the United States:
- **Canada:** 48.0% of GLA, contributing 45.6% of Q2 2025 Net Operating Income
- **United States:** 52.0% of GLA, contributing 54.4% of Q2 2025 Net Operating Income

Canadian properties are concentrated in Alberta (Calgary, Greater Edmonton Area) and other major markets, while U.S. properties provide geographic and currency diversification.

**Asset Class Breakdown:**
- **Industrial:** 34.4% of GLA, contributing 24.2% of Q2 2025 NOI
- **Office:** 54.7% of GLA, contributing 60.7% of Q2 2025 NOI
- **Retail/Residential:** 10.9% of GLA, contributing 15.1% of Q2 2025 NOI

The concentration in office assets (54.7% of GLA, 60.7% of NOI) represents the most significant business risk, given structural headwinds from hybrid work trends and office demand uncertainty.

**Management and Governance:**
Artis operates with a Board of Trustees governance structure typical of Canadian REITs, with oversight responsibilities including:
- Board Diversity and Renewal Policy
- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy
- ESG oversight and reporting (annual ESG Report aligned with SASB, GRI, UN SDGs, and TCFD frameworks)

The REIT conducts annual employee engagement surveys and tenant satisfaction surveys, demonstrating commitment to stakeholder management.

**Strategic Evolution:**
Artis has transitioned from a growth-oriented acquisition strategy (typical of REITs in the 2010s) to a **capital recycling and portfolio optimization strategy** focused on:
1. **Monetizing non-core assets** at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values
2. **Maximizing value on a tax-efficient basis** through strategic disposition timing
3. **Reducing leverage** and improving balance sheet flexibility
4. **Returning capital to unitholders** via the Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) when units trade below NAV

This strategic shift reflects management's assessment that capital recycling and value realization are more accretive than growth through acquisition in the current market environment.

**ESG Commitments:**
Artis has established comprehensive environmental, social, and governance initiatives, including:
- Annual ESG reporting incorporating SASB Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard, GRI 2021 Universal Standards, and UN Sustainable Development Goals
- Climate-related risk disclosure aligned with Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
- Diversity targets for Board, senior leadership, and overall workforce
- Environmental efficiency measurement and improvement across the portfolio, working with tenants to reduce energy, water, and waste consumption

Additional ESG information is available on the REIT's website at www.artisreit.com.

### Business Strategy

Artis's business strategy has evolved significantly from a traditional REIT growth model to a **value-focused capital recycling and portfolio optimization strategy**. Based on the Q2 2025 Management's Discussion and Analysis and calculated metrics, the strategy comprises four key pillars:

### 1. Strategic Asset Disposition Program

**Objective:** Monetize assets at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values to unlock value and reduce leverage.

**Execution (Q2 2025):**
During the second quarter of 2025, Artis sold one retail property in Canada for $4.75 million (sale proceeds net of costs: $4.54 million). This represents continuation of a multi-year disposition program that has reduced the portfolio from prior peak levels.

**Forward Strategy:**
Management states: *"The REIT will continue to evaluate the sale of a portion of its industrial, office and retail assets in an opportunistic and disciplined manner, with the goal of selling assets at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values and maximizing value on a tax-efficient basis."*

**Credit Implications:**
This strategy is credit-positive if executed successfully (assets sold at ≥100% of book value with proceeds applied to debt reduction). However, execution risk is substantial - the Downside scenario demonstrates that dispositions at 90% of book value would materially impair credit metrics. The phrase "opportunistic and disciplined" suggests management will not pursue distressed sales, but this discipline may limit deleveraging pace if market conditions weaken.

**Scale of Opportunity:**
With gross assets of $2.61 billion and leverage target implied at 38-40%, Artis could sell $200-300 million of assets over 18-24 months to achieve target leverage while maintaining operational scale. Q2 2025 disposition pace ($4.75 million) is well below this run rate, suggesting either selective asset marketing or limited buyer appetite at acceptable prices.

---

### 2. Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) Program

**Objective:** Enhance unitholder value through opportunistic unit repurchases when trading below net asset value (NAV).

**Program Details:**
The NCIB was renewed effective December 19, 2024, allowing Artis to repurchase common units on the open market. With NAV per unit at $12.98 as of June 30, 2025 (down 5.6% from $13.75 at December 31, 2024), management can execute accretive buybacks if units trade at significant discounts to NAV (e.g., $10-11 per unit, 15-20% discount).

**Management View:**
*"Artis continues to view its Normal Course Issuer Bid ("NCIB") as a valuable tool to enhance unitholder value."*

**Credit Implications:**
The NCIB creates inherent tension between capital allocation priorities:
- **Credit-positive:** Reduces unit count, improving per-unit metrics (FFO per unit, NAV per unit) and demonstrating capital discipline
- **Credit-negative:** Diverts cash flow from debt reduction, limiting deleveraging pace and maintaining elevated leverage longer

During Q2 2025, the weighted-average unit count declined due to NCIB activity, contributing to the 41% year-over-year decline in FFO per unit (total FFO fell, but per-unit impact was partially offset by lower unit count). The credit rating assessment assumes NCIB activity remains modest (≤$10-15 million annually) and subordinated to deleveraging priorities.

**Strategic Signal:**
Active NCIB use suggests management believes units are undervalued relative to intrinsic NAV, which could indicate confidence in asset values and disposition potential. However, it also signals that disposition proceeds are not being applied exclusively to debt reduction, creating credit rating friction.

---

### 3. Distribution Policy and Capital Allocation

**Current Policy:**
Artis maintains quarterly distributions of **$0.15 per common unit** ($0.60 annually), supported by distributions on Preferred Units Series E ($0.44 annually) and Series I ($0.87 annually).

**Sustainability Analysis:**
As detailed in Key Observations (Section 8), the current distribution policy is **unsustainable**:
- FFO payout ratio: 88.2% (high end of sustainable range)
- AFFO payout ratio: 187.5% (critically elevated, consuming nearly 2x available cash flow)

The scenario analysis (Section 10) demonstrates that even aggressive operational improvements and disposition execution require distribution cuts to restore sustainability:
- **Base Case:** AFFO payout remains 175.8% (improving but still unsustainable)
- **Upside Case:** 20% distribution cut + strong operations achieve 120% payout (approaching sustainable)
- **Downside Case:** AFFO payout rises to 223.1% (crisis level)
- **Stress Case:** 60% distribution cut only achieves 153.6% payout (still elevated)

**Management Communication:**
The Q2 2025 MD&A does not announce or signal distribution policy changes, suggesting management is maintaining current levels despite clear unsustainability. This creates significant credit risk, as the policy forces a binary choice:
1. **Cut distributions** to restore sustainability → unitholder dissatisfaction, potential governance pressure, unit price decline
2. **Maintain distributions** despite unsustainability → continued balance sheet deterioration, potential covenant breaches, credit rating downgrades

**Strategic Inference:**
Management appears to be **prioritizing unitholder income and unit price stability** over immediate balance sheet deleveraging, likely assessing that:
- Disposition proceeds will gradually improve coverage and allow distribution sustainability to improve without formal cuts
- Unitholder tolerance for distribution cuts is low, and cuts would trigger unit price decline offsetting NAV accretion benefits
- External growth opportunities are limited, so returning capital to unitholders via distributions and NCIB is more accretive than retaining cash

This is a **high-risk financial policy** that constrains the credit rating at Ba2/Ba3 and creates meaningful downgrade risk if disposition execution disappoints.

### 4. Portfolio Management and Operating Excellence

**Leasing and Occupancy Strategy:**
Artis's operational strategy focuses on:
- **Maximizing occupancy:** Portfolio occupancy improved from 87.1% (Q1 2025) to 87.8% (Q2 2025), with commitments bringing total to 89.0%
- **Positive rent reversion:** Weighted-average renewal rent increases of 3.6% during Q2 2025 demonstrate pricing power
- **Lease renewal focus:** 210,643 SF of renewals vs. 126,306 SF of new leases shows emphasis on tenant retention
- **Same-property NOI growth:** 2.3% six-month growth (Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024) reflects successful rent growth and expense management

**Capital Expenditure Management:**
The wide gap between FFO ($16.956 million in Q2 2025) and AFFO ($8.204 million) reflects significant capital expenditure requirements to maintain and improve properties. Management is balancing:
- **Maintenance capex:** Required to sustain occupancy and competitive positioning
- **Value-add capex:** Strategic investments to improve NOI and facilitate disposition at premium values
- **Cash flow preservation:** Limiting discretionary capex to maintain financial flexibility

**Asset Class Strategy Inferences:**
While not explicitly stated, management actions suggest implicit asset class preferences:
1. **Industrial:** No indication of industrial dispositions, suggesting this 34.4% of GLA is viewed as core and likely targeted for retention/growth
2. **Office:** 54.7% of GLA represents significant exposure; disposition comments include office, suggesting selective trimming of weaker assets
3. **Retail:** Active disposition of retail (Q2 2025 sale) suggests this 10.9% of GLA may be non-core, particularly smaller/non-grocery-anchored assets

**Geographic Strategy:**
The 48% Canada / 52% U.S. split appears strategically balanced, providing:
- Currency diversification (CAD/USD hedge)
- Market access across two economies with different cycle timing
- Regulatory diversification (Canadian REIT tax rules vs. U.S. REIT rules)

No indication of geographic rebalancing is evident, suggesting management views current mix as appropriate.

### Strategic Assessment and Credit Implications

**Coherence and Execution Risk:**
Artis's strategy is **coherent but execution-dependent**. The vision of becoming a "best-in-class real estate asset management and investment platform focused on value investing" aligns with:
- Active disposition program (value realization)
- NCIB program (capital allocation discipline when units undervalued)
- Operating excellence (maximizing NOI to support disposition pricing)

However, **execution risk is substantial**:
- Disposition pace (one $4.75M retail sale in Q2 2025) is insufficient to achieve meaningful deleveraging
- Distribution policy sustainability is critically challenged, forcing near-term policy choice
- Office market exposure (54.7% of GLA) creates vulnerability to secular demand decline

**Competitive Positioning:**
Compared to peer Canadian REITs:
- **Asset class focus peers** (Nexus Industrial, Slate Grocery) benefit from sector-specific expertise and investor clarity; Artis's diversification creates strategic ambiguity
- **Office-focused peers** (Dream Office) face similar challenges but have more explicitly embraced deleveraging and distribution rationalization; Artis lags this adjustment
- **Large-cap diversified REITs** benefit from scale and capital access advantages Artis cannot match at $2.6B asset size

Artis appears caught in a **strategic middle ground**: too diversified to benefit from sector specialization, too small to benefit from scale advantages, and too distribution-committed to optimize balance sheet. This positioning contributes to the Ba2/Ba3 credit rating.

**Catalyst for Strategic Shift:**
The unsustainable AFFO payout ratio (187.5%) will likely force strategic evolution within 6-12 months:
- **Scenario A (Credit-Positive):** Formal distribution cut (20-30%) combined with accelerated disposition program and explicit deleveraging targets → supports rating improvement to Ba1
- **Scenario B (Credit-Neutral):** Gradual disposition execution with modest distribution coverage improvement, maintaining current financial policy → sustains Ba2/Ba3 rating
- **Scenario C (Credit-Negative):** Continued high payout amid slowing disposition execution, forcing covenant pressure and potential distressed capital raise → triggers downgrade to Ba3/B1

**Strategic Recommendation (Credit Analyst Perspective):**
To improve credit profile and support rating upgrade, Artis should:
1. **Announce formal distribution reduction** (20-30%) with commitment to apply savings to debt reduction, targeting FFO payout <75% and AFFO payout <100% within 12 months
2. **Establish quantitative deleveraging targets:** Debt/Assets <38% and coverage >2.25x within 18-24 months
3. **Accelerate disposition program:** $150-200 million over 12-18 months, with explicit commitment to apply 100% of proceeds to debt paydown (suspending NCIB during deleveraging phase)
4. **Clarify asset class strategy:** Signal whether office trimming or retention is intended, providing investor clarity on portfolio evolution

These actions would align financial policy with credit quality objectives and position Artis for investment-grade trajectory over 3-5 years.

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

To assess credit resilience under varying operating environments, we model four scenarios with quantified impact on key credit metrics:

### Scenario Assumptions and Pro Forma Metrics:

#### **Scenario 1: Base Case (Most Likely, 12-Month Horizon)**

**Assumptions:**
- Asset dispositions: $75 million at 100% of book value, proceeds applied to debt reduction
- Same-property NOI growth: 2.5% (consistent with recent trends)
- Occupancy: Stable at 88.0% (modest improvement)
- Interest rates: Revolving credit facility rates average 6.0% (current market)
- Distribution: Maintained at current $0.15/unit quarterly ($0.60 annually)

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Total Debt:** $1,004 million (current $1,079M - $75M disposition paydown)
- **Gross Assets:** $2,536 million (current $2,611M - $75M asset sales)
- **Debt/Gross Assets:** 39.6% (improvement from 41.3%)
- **Annualized NOI:** $127 million (current $123M × 1.025 growth - $4M from disposed assets)
- **Annual Interest Expense:** $65 million (reduced debt at 6.5% blended rate)
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 1.95x (improvement from 1.81x)
- **FFO:** $68 million annually ($17M quarterly × 4)
- **AFFO:** $33 million annually ($8.2M quarterly × 4)
- **FFO Payout Ratio:** 85.3% (modest improvement from 88.2%)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 175.8% (modest improvement from 187.5%)

**Rating Impact:** **Ba2 (stable)** - Modest deleveraging and coverage improvement support rating affirmation with stable outlook. AFFO payout remains elevated but trending in correct direction.

---

#### **Scenario 2: Upside Case (Optimistic, 12-Month Horizon)**

**Assumptions:**
- Asset dispositions: $150 million at 105% of book value (premium to book), aggressive debt paydown
- Same-property NOI growth: 4.0% (strong leasing momentum, positive rent reversion)
- Occupancy: Improves to 90.0% (including commitments converting)
- Interest rates: Successful refinancing at 5.5% average (improved credit profile)
- Distribution: Reduced to $0.12/unit quarterly ($0.48 annually, 20% cut) to support deleveraging

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Total Debt:** $922 million (current $1,079M - $157.5M disposition paydown including $7.5M premium)
- **Gross Assets:** $2,461 million (current $2,611M - $150M asset sales)
- **Debt/Gross Assets:** 37.5% (significant improvement from 41.3%)
- **Annualized NOI:** $129 million (current $123M × 1.04 growth - $2M from disposed assets)
- **Annual Interest Expense:** $59 million (reduced debt at 6.4% blended rate after refinancing)
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 2.19x (substantial improvement from 1.81x)
- **FFO:** $70 million annually (higher NOI, lower interest)
- **AFFO:** $38 million annually (improved operating leverage)
- **FFO Payout Ratio:** 65.9% (distribution cut + FFO growth)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 120.0% (approaching sustainable range)

**Rating Impact:** **Ba1 (positive outlook)** - Demonstrated deleveraging execution, distribution rationalization, and coverage improvement support one-notch upgrade with positive outlook toward Baa3. Continued progress would position REIT for investment-grade consideration.

---

#### **Scenario 3: Downside Case (Adverse, 12-Month Horizon)**

**Assumptions:**
- Asset dispositions: $50 million at 90% of book value (distressed pricing), limited debt paydown
- Same-property NOI growth: 0.5% (occupancy pressure, weak rent growth)
- Occupancy: Declines to 86.0% (office tenant departures, limited backfill)
- Interest rates: Revolving credit facility rates rise to 7.0% (Fed tightening, credit spread widening)
- Distribution: Maintained at $0.15/unit (management resists cut despite pressure)

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Total Debt:** $1,034 million (current $1,079M - $45M disposition paydown after $5M loss)
- **Gross Assets:** $2,556 million (current $2,611M - $50M asset sales - $5M write-down on remaining portfolio)
- **Debt/Gross Assets:** 40.4% (modest improvement from 41.3%, less than Base Case)
- **Annualized NOI:** $119 million (current $123M × 1.005 growth - $5M from disposed assets)
- **Annual Interest Expense:** $71 million (higher rates on elevated debt)
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 1.68x (deterioration from 1.81x)
- **FFO:** $60 million annually (lower NOI, higher interest)
- **AFFO:** $26 million annually (reduced capex flexibility pressures AFFO)
- **FFO Payout Ratio:** 96.6% (approaching unsustainable)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 223.1% (critically elevated)

**Rating Impact:** **Ba3 (negative outlook)** - Failed disposition execution, coverage deterioration, and unsustainable payout ratio create downgrade pressure. Negative outlook signals potential further downgrade to B1 if trends persist. Distribution cut becomes inevitable, creating unitholder dissatisfaction and potential governance stress.

---

#### **Scenario 4: Stress Case (Severe Recession, 18-24 Month Horizon)**

**Assumptions:**
- Asset dispositions: $0 (capital markets freeze, no buyers at acceptable prices)
- Same-property NOI growth: -8.0% (severe recession, office occupancy collapse to 75%, industrial holds at 90%, retail struggles)
- Occupancy: Declines to 82.0% portfolio-wide (office devastation partially offset by industrial resilience)
- Interest rates: Initial spike to 7.5%, then decline to 6.5% as recession deepens and Fed cuts (average 7.0%)
- Distribution: Cut to $0.06/unit quarterly ($0.24 annually, 60% cut) to preserve liquidity
- Covenant pressure: Approaching debt/asset covenant of 60% on secured facilities

**Pro Forma Metrics (24 months forward):**
- **Total Debt:** $1,079 million (unchanged, no asset sales, no paydown)
- **Gross Assets:** $2,350 million (current $2,611M - $261M fair value write-downs on office portfolio)
- **Debt/Gross Assets:** 45.9% (covenant pressure at 60% threshold)
- **Annualized NOI:** $102 million (current $123M × 0.92 = severe occupancy/rent decline)
- **Annual Interest Expense:** $73 million (higher rates on full debt load)
- **NOI/Interest Coverage:** 1.40x (critically weak)
- **FFO:** $40 million annually (devastated earnings)
- **AFFO:** $15 million annually (minimal retained cash flow)
- **FFO Payout Ratio:** 57.6% (post-distribution-cut, appears sustainable but only due to drastic cut)
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 153.6% (still elevated even after 60% distribution cut)

**Rating Impact:** **B1/B2 (negative outlook)** - Multi-notch downgrade reflects distressed credit profile with critically weak coverage (1.40x), elevated leverage approaching covenant thresholds (45.9%), and asset value impairment. Distribution cut of 60% would likely trigger significant unit price decline and potential governance changes. Refinancing risk becomes acute as credit facilities mature, potentially forcing additional asset sales at distressed prices or equity raise at steep dilution. Recovery to investment grade would require 3-5 years of sustained improvement.

### Scenario Summary Table:

| Metric | Current | Base Case | Upside Case | Downside Case | Stress Case |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 41.3% | 39.6% | 37.5% | 40.4% | 45.9% |
| **Coverage (x)** | 1.81x | 1.95x | 2.19x | 1.68x | 1.40x |
| **FFO Payout** | 88.2% | 85.3% | 65.9% | 96.6% | 57.6% |
| **AFFO Payout** | 187.5% | 175.8% | 120.0% | 223.1% | 153.6% |
| **Rating** | Ba2/Ba3 | Ba2 | Ba1 | Ba3 | B1/B2 |
| **Outlook** | Stable | Stable | Positive | Negative | Negative |

### Key Insights from Scenario Analysis:

**Distribution Policy is Central Credit Variable:**
Across all scenarios, the AFFO payout ratio is the most volatile and sensitive metric. Even in the Upside Case, achieving sustainable payout (120%) requires a 20% distribution cut plus strong operational performance. In Downside/Stress Cases, distribution cuts of 60% are insufficient to restore sustainability, demonstrating the severity of current policy weakness.

**Asset Disposition Execution is Critical:**
The difference between Base Case (Ba2) and Downside Case (Ba3) hinges primarily on $25 million of additional disposition proceeds ($75M vs. $50M) and pricing differential (100% vs. 90% of book). This narrow margin demonstrates significant execution risk and the importance of market timing in disposition strategy.

**Coverage is More Sensitive Than Leverage:**
Interest coverage moves from 2.19x (Upside) to 1.40x (Stress), a 36% swing, while leverage moves from 37.5% to 45.9%, a 22% swing. This reflects the REIT's limited operating leverage - small changes in NOI or interest expense create disproportionate coverage impact, making coverage the binding constraint on credit quality.

**Office Market Exposure is Key Tail Risk:**
The Stress Case assumes office occupancy collapse drives portfolio-wide NOI decline of 8%, with most damage concentrated in the 54.7% of GLA in office assets. This demonstrates office exposure as the single largest downside driver, supporting the argument for portfolio rebalancing toward industrial/retail.

**Time to Recovery Varies Significantly:**
Under Base Case, achieving Ba1 would take 18-24 months of continued execution. Under Downside Case, returning to current Ba2/Ba3 level would take 12-18 months. Under Stress Case, recovery to current rating would require 36-48 months, with multi-year path back to investment grade. This asymmetric recovery profile supports conservative credit positioning.

### Stress Testing Conclusion:
Artis's credit profile demonstrates **moderate resilience** under Base Case but **material vulnerability** under Downside/Stress scenarios. The rating is appropriately positioned at Ba2/Ba3, reflecting speculative-grade risk with elevated sensitivity to operating performance and capital markets conditions. Investors should monitor quarterly progress on asset dispositions, occupancy trends, and distribution policy for early warning signals of scenario trajectory.
