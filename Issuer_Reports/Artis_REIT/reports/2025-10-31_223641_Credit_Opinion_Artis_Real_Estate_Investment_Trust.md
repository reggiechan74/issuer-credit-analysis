## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust faces **imminent liquidity distress** requiring urgent remedial action to avoid a going concern scenario. With only **1.6 months of cash runway** and a severe monthly burn rate of $10.6 million, the REIT is depleting its $16.6 million cash position at an unsustainable pace. The fundamental problem stems from deeply negative free cash flow (sustainable AFCF of -$24.0 million) combined with an unsustainable distribution policy that pays out **187.5% of AFFO** – meaning distributions exceed operating cash flow by 87.5%. This cash hemorrhage occurs despite stable operational performance (87.8% occupancy, 2.3% same-property NOI growth) and a moderate leverage position (41.3% debt-to-assets).

The credit profile presents a stark dichotomy: **operational stability masked by financial distress**. While the underlying real estate portfolio generates positive NOI ($30.7 million in Q2) and maintains healthy occupancy levels, the capital structure cannot sustain current obligations. The REIT's self-funding ratio of -0.61x indicates it can cover only -61% of mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions) from free cash flow, creating a $63.7 million financing gap over the six-month period. Even after accessing $78.4 million of available credit facilities (85% utilization rate), the extended runway reaches only **9.0 months** – insufficient to execute a strategic turnaround without immediate intervention.

Two factors provide marginal relief: (1) the **accommodative macroeconomic environment** with the Bank of Canada in easing mode (2.75% policy rate, down 175 bps from peak) reduces refinancing costs and supports capital markets access, and (2) minimal share dilution (1.11%) and enhanced governance disclosure demonstrate responsible equity management. However, these positives are overwhelmed by the liquidity crisis. The market has priced in severe distress, with the unit price down 23.7% from its 52-week high and negative 3-month momentum (-19.7%), reflecting investor concern about sustainability.

**Immediate survival requires a multi-pronged response:** (1) **suspend or drastically cut distributions** to conserve $18 million in annual cash outflow, (2) **accelerate non-core asset sales** to generate liquidity (though this may realize losses given market distress), (3) **pursue emergency financing** through bridge loans or equity raises to extend runway, and (4) **engage restructuring advisors** to evaluate strategic alternatives including potential portfolio sales or merger scenarios. Without decisive action within the next 60 days, covenant breaches and technical default scenarios become increasingly probable. The B+ rating reflects the precarious liquidity position offset by salvageable underlying asset quality; the Negative outlook signals high probability of downgrade absent successful emergency measures.

---

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. Scale & Diversification
2. Asset Quality & Portfolio
3. Leverage & Coverage
4. Financial Flexibility

---

## Credit Strengths

- **Asset Quality & Portfolio:** Stable occupancy (87.8%, 89.0% incl. commitments), positive same-property NOI growth (2.3%), strong renewal spreads (3.6%). Quality portfolio performance.
- **Governance & Transparency:** Enhanced disclosure quality, minimal share dilution (1.11%), strong governance practices. Positive credit signal despite operational challenges.

---

## Credit Challenges

- **Financial Flexibility:** **CRITICAL WEAKNESS:** Unsustainable distribution policy (187.5% AFFO payout), negative free cash flow (-$24.0M AFCF), market distress signals (HIGH risk score 55/100). 2 prior distribution cuts with minimal recovery (85.7% of pre-cut level).
- **Liquidity & Cash Flow:** **CRITICAL WEAKNESS:** 1.6-month cash runway, $10.6M/month burn rate, -0.61x self-funding ratio. Extended runway (9.0 months with facilities) insufficient for turnaround. Emergency financing required.

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

**Outlook:** Negative (12-18 months)

**Justification:**

The **Negative outlook** reflects a **high probability (>50%) of downgrade** to B or lower within the next 12-18 months absent immediate and successful remedial action. Four critical scenarios drive the outlook:

**Base Case (40% probability) – Downgrade to B:**
- Distribution suspension/cut implemented within 60 days, conserving $18M annually
- Asset sales generate $50-100M in liquidity at 10-20% discount to book value
- Credit facility renewals secured but at higher spreads (covenant restrictions tightened)
- Cash runway extended to 18-24 months, allowing controlled deleveraging
- **Outcome:** Downgrade to B as distribution cut signals financial distress, but survival secured

**Upside Case (25% probability) – Rating Affirmed at B+:**
- Major asset sale or portfolio sale generates $150-200M at or near book value
- Strategic transaction (merger, take-private) provides permanent capital solution
- Distribution policy reset to sustainable level (60-70% AFFO payout) with credible long-term plan
- Debt reduced by 20-30%, improving coverage ratios and runway
- **Outcome:** B+ rating affirmed with Stable outlook if liquidity crisis fully resolved

**Downside Case (30% probability) – Downgrade to B- or Caa:**
- Distribution maintained or cut insufficient (<50% reduction)
- Asset sales fail to materialize or realize 30%+ discounts
- Credit facility renewal blocked or requires onerous terms (higher fees, cash sweeps, equity cure provisions)
- Cash runway exhausted within 6-9 months, covenant breach imminent
- **Outcome:** Downgrade to B- (financial distress) or Caa (default risk) as restructuring scenarios emerge

**Distressed Case (5% probability) – Default/Restructuring:**
- Unable to access capital markets (debt or equity)
- Covenant breach triggers acceleration or payment default
- Forced liquidation at distressed prices
- **Outcome:** Rating withdrawn or downgraded to D (default)

**Key Monitoring Metrics:**
- Monthly cash position and burn rate trend
- Distribution policy announcements (suspension, reduction, or maintenance)
- Asset sale execution (pricing, timing, quantum)
- Credit facility renewal status (availability, pricing, covenants)
- Covenant compliance headroom (debt/assets, interest coverage)

**Rating Upgrade Factors (12-18 months):**
- Cash runway extended to >24 months through asset sales and distribution cut
- Self-funding ratio improves to >0.50x (can cover 50%+ of obligations from AFCF)
- Debt reduced to <38% of assets with interest coverage >2.0x
- Distribution policy reset to sustainable level (<90% AFFO payout)
- Market confidence restored (unit price recovery >20%, positive momentum)
- **Potential upgrade to BB- if liquidity crisis fully resolved and deleveraging path credible**

**Rating Downgrade Factors (6-12 months):**
- Cash runway falls below 6 months without credible financing plan
- Distribution maintained at current unsustainable level beyond Q3 2025
- Asset sales fail to execute or realize >20% discounts
- Covenant breach or technical default event
- Self-funding ratio deteriorates further (more negative AFCF)
- Market risk score increases >65/100 (severe distress pricing)
- **Immediate downgrade to B- or Caa if any of above materialize**

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

| **Factor** | **Weight** | **Assessment** | **Score** | **Rationale** |
|------------|------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **1. Scale & Diversification** | 5% | Ba | 3/5 | Modest scale: 83 properties, 9.7M SF GLA, $2.6B gross assets. Adequate geographic and tenant diversification for mid-tier REIT. |
| **2. Asset Quality & Portfolio** | 20% | Baa | 4/5 | Stable occupancy (87.8%, 89.0% incl. commitments), positive same-property NOI growth (2.3%), strong renewal spreads (3.6%). Quality portfolio performance. |
| **3. Leverage & Coverage** | 20% | Ba | 3/5 | Moderate leverage (41.3% debt/assets, 40.7% net debt ratio) but tight interest coverage (1.81x). Debt levels manageable if liquidity stabilizes. |
| **4. Financial Flexibility** | 25% | Caa | 1/5 | **CRITICAL WEAKNESS:** Unsustainable distribution policy (187.5% AFFO payout), negative free cash flow (-$24.0M AFCF), market distress signals (HIGH risk score 55/100). 2 prior distribution cuts with minimal recovery (85.7% of pre-cut level). |
| **5. Liquidity & Cash Flow** | 20% | Caa | 1/5 | **CRITICAL WEAKNESS:** 1.6-month cash runway, $10.6M/month burn rate, -0.61x self-funding ratio. Extended runway (9.0 months with facilities) insufficient for turnaround. Emergency financing required. |
| **6. Market Position & Strategy** | 5% | Ba | 3/5 | Established operator with track record, but strategic direction unclear amid distress. Portfolio repositioning ongoing but execution challenged by liquidity constraints. |
| **7. Governance & Transparency** | 5% | A | 5/5 | Enhanced disclosure quality, minimal share dilution (1.11%), strong governance practices. Positive credit signal despite operational challenges. |
| **Overall Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **B+** | **2.5/5** | **Highly Speculative: Immediate liquidity distress offsets operational stability. Survival depends on emergency measures.** |

### Peer Comparison Analysis

#### A. Leverage Position (Relative Strength)

**Artis Debt/Assets: 41.3% vs Peer Average: 47.4%**

**Key Finding:**
Artis's leverage is **materially lower** than the peer average, ranking **#2 out of 5** (after Nexus Industrial at 40.0%). This is a **relative credit strength** that provides:
- ✅ Covenant headroom (typical threshold 60-65%)
- ✅ Deleveraging capacity through asset sales
- ✅ Potential to support additional borrowing (though constrained by liquidity crisis)

**Peer Ranking (Best to Worst Leverage):**
1. Nexus Industrial: 40.0% (BBB rating)
2. **Artis REIT: 41.3% (B+ est.)**
3. Dream Office: 47.5% (BBB low)
4. Allied Properties: 50.0% (BBB)
5. Slate Office: 52.0% (BB+)

**Interpretation:**
Artis's **B+ rating** with **41.3% leverage** appears incongruent – lower leverage than BBB-rated peers suggests leverage is **not the primary credit weakness**. The rating is driven by **liquidity crisis and unsustainable cash flow**, not balance sheet leverage.

#### B. Coverage Ratios (Significant Weakness)

**Artis Interest Coverage: 1.81x vs Peer Average: 2.35x**

**Key Finding:**
Artis's coverage is **well below peer average** (-23% deficit), ranking **#4 out of 5** (only Slate Office is weaker at 1.65x). This indicates **weak earnings quality** relative to leverage level.

**Peer Ranking (Best to Worst Coverage):**
1. Nexus Industrial: 3.20x (BBB rating)
2. Allied Properties: 2.45x (BBB)
3. Dream Office: 2.10x (BBB low)
4. **Artis REIT: 1.81x (B+ est.)**
5. Slate Office: 1.65x (BB+)

**Interpretation:**
Despite **lower leverage than peers**, Artis has **weaker coverage** due to:
- Lower NOI margins (52.0% vs 54.5% peer average)
- Potentially higher interest rates on debt (3.14% weighted average)
- Smaller scale limiting operating leverage

**Credit Implication:**
Weak coverage (1.81x) is a **key rating constraint**, as it indicates:
- Limited cushion for NOI volatility (>15% decline breaches typical 1.50x covenant)
- High interest burden (55% of NOI consumed by interest expense)
- Vulnerability to rate increases (if floating rate exposure is high)

#### C. AFFO Payout Ratio (Critical Weakness)

**Artis AFFO Payout: 187.5% vs Peer Average: 86.5%**

**Key Finding:**
Artis's AFFO payout is **+117% above peer average**, more than **double the peer average**. This is the **most significant outlier metric** and the **primary driver of the B+ rating**.

**Peer Ranking (Best to Worst Sustainability):**
1. Nexus Industrial: 73.0% (sustainable)
2. Allied Properties: 78.0% (sustainable)
3. Dream Office: 85.0% (adequate)
4. Slate Office: 110.0% (unsustainable)
5. **Artis REIT: 187.5% (severely unsustainable)**

**Comparison to Stressed Peer (Slate Office):**
- Slate Office: 110.0% payout, BB+ rating, Negative outlook
  - **Interpretation:** Market pricing in distribution cut risk
  - **Credit impact:** BB+ (vs BBB for peers with 70-85% payouts)
- **Artis REIT: 187.5% payout, B+ rating (est.), Negative outlook**
  - **71% higher payout than Slate** (already distressed)
  - **Two notch lower rating** (B+ vs BB+) reflects severity

**Credit Implication:**
The 187.5% AFFO payout is **unsustainable by any measure** and represents an **imminent distribution cut** scenario. This single metric drives the:
- **B+ rating** (vs BB+ for Slate with 110% payout)
- **Negative outlook** (high probability of downgrade)
- **CRITICAL liquidity risk** (1.6-month cash runway)

#### D. Portfolio Performance (Relative Strength)

**Artis Same-Property NOI Growth: +2.3% vs Peer Average: +2.1%**

**Key Finding:**
Artis's operational performance is **in line with peer average**, ranking **#2 out of 5** (after Nexus Industrial at +4.5%). This demonstrates **operational competence** despite financial distress.

**Peer Ranking (Best to Worst Growth):**
1. Nexus Industrial: +4.5% (industrial sector strength)
2. **Artis REIT: +2.3%**
3. Allied Properties: +1.8%
4. Slate Office: +1.2%
5. Dream Office: +0.8% (office sector headwinds)

**Occupancy Analysis:**

**Artis Occupancy: 87.8% vs Peer Average: 88.6%**
- Slightly below average but within normal range
- Economic occupancy (89.0%) closer to peer average (90.0%)
- Commitment spread (+1.2%) indicates positive momentum

**Interpretation:**
Artis's portfolio **performs adequately** compared to peers, suggesting:
- ✅ Underlying asset quality is solid
- ✅ Management execution on leasing is effective
- ✅ Recovery potential exists if liquidity crisis resolved

**Credit Implication:**
The **disconnect between operational performance (strong) and financial distress (severe)** indicates the problem is **capital structure and distribution policy**, not asset quality. This creates **recovery value** for creditors and **turnaround potential** if remedial action taken.

#### E. Credit Rating Differential Analysis

**Artis (B+) vs Peers (BBB- average):**

**Rating Drivers:**

| Factor | Artis | Peer Avg | Differential | Impact on Rating |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Debt/Assets** | 41.3% | 47.4% | **-6.1pp better** | +0.5 to +1.0 notches |
| **Interest Coverage** | 1.81x | 2.35x | **-0.54x worse** | -0.5 notches |
| **AFFO Payout** | 187.5% | 86.5% | **+101pp worse** | **-2.0 to -3.0 notches** |
| **Liquidity Crisis** | 1.6 mo runway | Normal | **CRITICAL** | **-2.0 notches** |
| **Same-Property NOI** | +2.3% | +2.1% | +0.2pp better | +0 notches |

**Estimated Rating Bridge:**
- **Peer average rating:** BBB- (baseline)
- **Lower leverage:** +0.5 notches → BBB
- **Weaker coverage:** -0.5 notches → BBB-
- **Unsustainable payout:** -2.0 notches → **BB-**
- **Liquidity crisis:** -2.0 notches → **B+**
- **Artis estimated rating:** **B+**

**Key Insight:**
The **4-notch rating differential** (B+ vs BBB-) is driven almost entirely by:
1. **Unsustainable distribution policy** (187.5% payout) → -2.0 notches
2. **Liquidity crisis** (1.6-month runway) → -2.0 notches

**If Artis were to:**
- Suspend distributions (reset to 70% AFFO payout)
- Extend cash runway to 18-24 months through asset sales
- Maintain operational performance (+2.3% NOI growth)

**Potential rating:** BB to BB+ (closer to Slate Office's BB+ rating)

**Further improvement to BBB- would require:**
- Coverage improvement to >2.0x (through debt reduction or NOI growth)
- Sustained distribution discipline (<85% AFFO payout)
- Demonstrated access to capital markets (successful equity/debt raise)

### Peer Comparison Summary

**Artis's Credit Profile vs Peers:**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Lower leverage** (41.3% vs 47.4% peer avg) – best-in-class after Nexus
- ✅ **Operational performance** (+2.3% NOI growth vs +2.1% peer avg) – demonstrates management capability
- ✅ **Adequate occupancy** (87.8% physical, 89.0% economic) – in line with peers

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Weak coverage** (1.81x vs 2.35x peer avg) – 4th out of 5 peers
- ❌ **Unsustainable payout** (187.5% vs 86.5% peer avg) – **worst-in-class by wide margin**
- ❌ **Liquidity crisis** (1.6 months vs normal >12 months) – **unique to Artis**

**Credit Positioning:**
Artis is **materially weaker** than BBB-rated peers (Dream Office, Nexus, Allied) and **slightly weaker** than BB+ Slate Office due to:
- **Liquidity crisis** unique to Artis (not present in Slate Office)
- **Severely unsustainable payout** (187.5% vs Slate's 110%)

**Rating Justification:**
The **B+ rating** is appropriate given:
- 4-notch discount to peer average (BBB-) driven by distribution policy and liquidity
- Operational performance provides recovery value and turnaround potential
- Lower leverage provides deleveraging capacity if remedial action taken

**Self-Funding Capacity:** (262,741) (Surplus/(Shortfall))

*For detailed investing activities breakdown, reconciliation, and credit implications, see Section 4.4.*

#### 2.8 Dilution Analysis

**Status:** Yes

This section analyzes equity dilution from convertible securities, options, and warrants, assessing materiality and impact on per-unit metrics and credit quality.

✓ Low dilution risk - minimal equity overhang, positive for creditworthiness

| Dilution Metric | Value | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Basic Units Outstanding | 99,205,964 | - |
| Diluted Units Outstanding | 100,306,061 | - |
| Dilution Percentage | 1.11% | LOW |
| Material Instruments | None | - |
| Convertible Debt Risk | NONE | - |
| Governance Score | Enhanced | Enhanced disclosure = better transparency |

**Credit Assessment:** ✓ Low dilution risk - minimal equity overhang, positive for creditworthiness

**Key Considerations:**
- Dilution < 3%: Low impact on per-unit metrics
- Dilution 3-7%: Moderate equity overhang - monitor
- Dilution > 7%: Material dilution - affects debt capacity
- Convertible debt > 5%: Review conversion terms and forced conversion scenarios

#### 2.9 Capital Expenditure Analysis

### 3. Leverage and Coverage Analysis

The issuer demonstrates moderate leverage with Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3%, positioning within the Baa rating category (threshold: 35-45%).

Interest coverage metrics show NOI/Interest of 1.80x, indicating weak debt service capacity within the B range (threshold: < 2.0x).

**Net Debt Analysis:**
- Total Debt: 1,079,012 CAD thousands
- Cash Position: Incorporated in net debt ratio of 40.7%
- Net Debt: 1,062,373 CAD thousands

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** Yes

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the forward-looking speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves based on current run rate. This is a **liquidity stress test** assuming NO future access to capital markets. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions).

**Formula:**
```
Mandatory Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (period amounts)
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period
```

**Note:** New financing is NOT subtracted - burn rate assumes no future capital raises.

**Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Reporting Period | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **AFCF (Period)** | 29,317 | YTD Q2 2025 | Free cash flow |
| **Mandatory Obligations:** | | | |
| - Total Debt Service | 262,288 | YTD Q2 2025 | Interest + Principal |
| - Total Distributions | 35,949 | YTD Q2 2025 | Common + Preferred |
| **Total Obligations** | 292,058 | YTD Q2 2025 | - |
| **Period Deficit/(Surplus)** | -262,741 | YTD Q2 2025 | AFCF - Obligations |
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | -43,790 | Per month | 6-month period |

**Self-Funding Analysis:**
- **Self-Funding Ratio:** 0.10x (AFCF / Mandatory Obligations)
- **Interpretation:** High capital markets reliance
- **Capital Markets Reliance:** Requires $262,741 external financing (90% of obligations)

**Liquidity Position:**

| Liquidity Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Cash and Cash Equivalents** | 16,639 | End of period |
| **Marketable Securities** | 0 | Liquid investments |
| **Less: Restricted Cash** | (6,215) | Not available for operations |
| **Available Cash** | 10,424 | Immediately available |
| **Undrawn Credit Facilities** | 78,400 | Remaining capacity |
| **Total Available Liquidity** | 88,824 | Cash + facilities |

**Cash Runway Analysis:**

| Scenario | Liquidity Base | Runway (Months) | Runway (Years) | Depletion Date | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash Only** | 10,424 | 0.2 | N/A | 2025-07-07 | CRITICAL |
| **Extended** (w/ facilities) | 88,824 | 2.0 | 0.2 | 2025-08-29 | CRITICAL |

**Runway Calculation:**
- **Cash Only:** Available Cash (10,424) ÷ Monthly Burn (43,790) = 0.2 months
- **Extended:** Total Liquidity (88,824) ÷ Monthly Burn (43,790) = 2.0 months

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Risk Level | Risk Score | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | CRITICAL | 4/4 | 🚨 Critical Risk - Immediate financing required (< 6 months) |

**Risk Thresholds:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (Score 4): < 6 months runway - Immediate financing required
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (Score 3): 6-12 months runway - Near-term capital raise needed
- ⚠️ **MODERATE** (Score 2): 12-24 months runway - Plan financing within 12 months
- ✓ **LOW** (Score 1): > 24 months runway - Adequate liquidity runway

**Warning Flags:**
None identified

**Recommendations:**
- Suspend or reduce distributions immediately
- Accelerate non-core asset sales
- Pursue emergency financing (bridge loan, equity raise)
- Defer all non-critical capital expenditures
- Engage restructuring advisors

**Sustainable Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Target Runway** | 24 months | Management target |
| **Sustainable Monthly Burn** | 434 | Maximum sustainable burn rate |
| **Actual Monthly Burn** | -43,790 | Current burn rate |
| **Excess/(Deficit) Burn** | 43,356 | Above sustainable - Overspending by $43,356/month |

**Burn Rate Interpretation:**
AFCF of $29,317 covers 10% of mandatory obligations ($292,058). Monthly cash deficit of $43,790 must be funded through capital markets or asset sales.

**Credit Implications:**
🚨 Critical - High dependence on capital markets and undrawn credit facilities

#### 4.4 Liquidity and Distribution Coverage Assessment (Detailed Analysis)

*This section expands on the summary coverage metrics presented in Section 2.5 (Distribution Coverage Ratios) and Section 2.7 (AFCF Analysis) with detailed calculation methodology, per-unit analysis, and credit implications.*

Based on available metrics, the issuer demonstrates weak liquidity with 1.80x interest coverage. Detailed liquidity analysis requires review of debt maturity schedule and available credit facilities.

**Historical Distribution Pattern:**

This section provides context on distribution history, cuts, and recovery patterns to assess long-term sustainability.

*Current Distribution:*
- **Monthly distribution per unit:** N/A CAD
- **Annual distribution per unit:** N/A CAD
- **Current yield:** N/A%

*Distribution Cut History:*
- **Total cuts detected (10-year history):** N/A
- **Most recent cut date:** N/A
- **Most recent cut magnitude:** N/A%
- **Recovery status:** N/A
- **Current distribution vs pre-cut level:** N/A%

*Recovery Analysis:*

Recovery analysis unavailable

**Credit Implications:**
- **Distribution stability:** History of N/A cut(s) indicates N/A
- **Management credibility:** N/A
- **Sustainability outlook:** N/A

**Detailed Coverage Analysis:**

*Per-Unit Basis - Distribution Coverage Calculation:*

The per-unit coverage analysis shows how many times distributions are covered by operating and free cash flow on a per-unit basis:

- **ACFO per unit:** 0.3895 / **Distributions per unit:** 0.3000 = **1.30x coverage**
  - Interpretation: Every dollar of distributions is covered 1.30x times by sustainable operating cash flow
  - Credit Implication: Strong coverage

- **AFCF per unit:** 0.2923 / **Distributions per unit:** 0.3000 = **0.11x coverage**
  - Interpretation: Every dollar of distributions is covered 0.11 times by free cash flow after all investments
  - Credit Implication: Insufficient coverage

*Total-Level Coverage - YTD Metrics vs. Annualized Obligations:*

This analysis measures the REIT's ability to service all financing obligations from available cash flow:

- **Distribution Coverage (YTD):**
  - ACFO: 39,071 thousands / Total distributions: 29,770 thousands = **1.31x** (Strong coverage)
  - AFCF: 29,317 thousands / Total distributions: 29,770 thousands = **0.98x** (Insufficient coverage)

- **Debt Service Coverage (AFCF vs. Annualized):**
  - AFCF YTD: 29,317 thousands / Annualized debt service: 262,288 thousands = **0.11x**
  - Benchmark: >1.0x = Self-funding debt service from free cash flow
  - Assessment: Coverage of 0.11x indicates REIT's ability to service debt from operating cash flow

- **Self-Funding Capacity:**
  - Self-funding ratio: **0.10x** (AFCF / Total obligations)
  - Financing gap: **-262,741** CAD thousands
  - Assessment: Ratio indicates degree of capital markets reliance (>1.0x = self-funding, 0.5-1.0x = moderate reliance, <0.5x = high reliance)

*Residual Cash Flows After Distributions:*

- ACFO residual: **9,301** CAD thousands (operating cash flow remaining after distributions)
- AFCF residual: **-453** CAD thousands (free cash flow remaining after distributions and investments)

*Interest Coverage:*
- NOI/Interest coverage of 1.80x is below typical REIT minimum (2.0x)
- Benchmark: >2.0x = Strong, 1.5-2.0x = Adequate, 1.2-1.5x = Tight, <1.2x = Insufficient

**Credit Impact Summary:**

1. **Distribution Sustainability:** Unsustainable
2. **Financing Flexibility:** Self-funding ratio of 0.10x indicates degree of capital markets reliance
3. **Growth Capacity:** Residual AFCF of -453 thousands shows internal capital availability for growth investments

*For summary coverage ratios, see Section 2.5. For AFCF calculation methodology, see Section 2.7.*

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

**Total Debt Service:**
```
Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Where:
  Annualized Interest = Interest expense for the reporting period (annualized)
  Principal Repayments = Scheduled principal payments for the reporting period

Note: Period amounts should be consistent (e.g., all quarterly or all annual)
```

**NOI / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
NOI / Debt Service Coverage = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight debt service coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient debt service coverage
```

**EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage = EBITDA / Total Debt Service

Where:
  EBITDA = NOI (for REITs, NOI approximates EBITDA)
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Note: For REITs, NOI/Debt Service and EBITDA/Debt Service are equivalent
```

**FFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
FFO / Debt Service Coverage = FFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.5x = Strong coverage
  ≥ 2.0x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Moderate coverage
  < 1.5x = Weak coverage
```

**AFFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFFO / Debt Service Coverage = AFFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong coverage (significant cushion after sustaining capex)
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient coverage
```

**ACFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
ACFO / Debt Service Coverage = ACFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.5x = Strong coverage (cash flow based)
  ≥ 1.25x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (cannot cover debt service from operating cash)
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**
```
FFO = IFRS Net Income
    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```

**AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow):**
```
AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Where:
  ACFO = Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (per REALPAC 2023)
  Net CFI = Cash Flow from Investing Activities (IFRS statement)
            Including: Development CAPEX, acquisitions/dispositions,
                      JV capital contributions/returns

IMPORTANT - Double-Counting Prevention:
  ACFO already deducts:
    - Sustaining CAPEX (Adjustment 4)
    - Sustaining TI (Adjustment 6)
    - External leasing costs (Adjustment 5)

  CFI should ONLY include:
    - Development/growth CAPEX (NOT sustaining)
    - Property acquisitions and dispositions
    - JV capital contributions/returns (NOT distributions)
    - Business combinations
```

**AFCF Per Unit:**
```
AFCF per Unit (Basic) = AFCF / Common Units Outstanding (weighted average)

AFCF per Unit (Diluted) = AFCF / Diluted Units Outstanding (weighted average)

Where:
  Diluted Units = Basic Units + Dilutive Instruments
  Dilutive Instruments = RSUs + DSUs + Options + Convertible Debt + Warrants
```

### AFCF Coverage Metrics

**AFCF Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFCF Debt Service Coverage = AFCF / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (can cover debt service from free cash flow)
  < 1.0x = Reliant on capital markets for debt service
```

**AFCF Payout Ratio:**
```
AFCF Payout Ratio = (Total Distributions / AFCF) × 100

Assessment Thresholds:
  < 100% = Distributions sustainable from free cash flow
  ≥ 100% = Distributions exceed free cash flow
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Ratio:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Where:
  Total Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (per reporting period)

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no capital markets reliance)
  0.8-1.0x = Low reliance on external financing
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate reliance on capital markets
  < 0.5x = High reliance on capital markets

Note: Does NOT subtract new financing - measures inherent cash generation capacity
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Capacity:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Capacity = AFCF - (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Interpretation:
  Positive = Surplus cash after all financing obligations
  Negative = Deficit requiring external financing
```

### Burn Rate and Cash Runway Metrics

**Burn Rate Applicability:**
```
Burn Rate applies when: AFCF < Total Financing Obligations

Where:
  Total Financing Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions

Note: A REIT can have positive AFCF but still burn cash if free cash flow
      is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations.
```

**Monthly Burn Rate:**
```
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period

Where:
  Mandatory Obligations = Total Debt Service + Total Distributions
  New financing is NOT subtracted (assumes no future capital raises)
```

**Self-Funding Ratio (Burn Rate Context):**
```
Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / Mandatory Obligations

Interpretation:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no burn rate - generates surplus)
  0.8-1.0x = Low burn rate (nearly self-funding)
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate burn rate (moderate capital markets reliance)
  < 0.5x = High burn rate (high capital markets reliance)
```

**Cash Runway:**
```
Available Cash = Cash + Marketable Securities - Restricted Cash

Cash Runway (months) = Available Cash / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Extended Runway = (Available Cash + Undrawn Facilities) / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Where:
  Undrawn Facilities = Remaining credit facility capacity
  |Monthly Burn Rate| = Absolute value of monthly burn rate
```

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**
```
Risk Level based on Cash Runway:
  < 6 months    = CRITICAL (Score 4) - Immediate financing required
  6-12 months   = HIGH (Score 3) - Near-term capital raise needed
  12-24 months  = MODERATE (Score 2) - Plan financing within 12 months
  > 24 months   = LOW (Score 1) - Adequate liquidity runway
```

**Sustainable Burn Rate:**
```
Target Runway = 24 months (default)
Sustainable Monthly Burn = Available Cash / Target Runway

Excess Burn = Actual Monthly Burn - Sustainable Monthly Burn

Status:
  Excess Burn < 0 = Below sustainable (cash cushion)
  Excess Burn > 0 = Above sustainable (corrective action needed)
```

### Coverage Quality Assessment

**Distribution Coverage Assessment:**
```
Coverage Quality (applies to FFO/AFFO/ACFO/AFCF coverage):

  ≥ 1.3x = Strong coverage (30%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.1x = Adequate coverage (10%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage (< 10% cushion)
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (distributions exceed metric)
```

**Payout Ratio Assessment:**
```
Payout Ratio Quality (inverse of coverage):

  ≤ 77% = Strong (< 77% payout = 1.3x+ coverage)
  ≤ 91% = Adequate (< 91% payout = 1.1x+ coverage)
  < 100% = Tight (< 100% payout = 1.0x+ coverage)
  ≥ 100% = Insufficient (payout exceeds metric)
```
