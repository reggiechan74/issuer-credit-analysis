## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** BB+ to BBB- (Lower Investment Grade / Upper Non-Investment Grade)

Artis Real Estate Investment Trust is a diversified Canadian REIT undergoing strategic portfolio repositioning through selective asset monetization and balance sheet strengthening. The REIT's credit profile reflects moderate leverage (Debt/Assets of 41.3%), adequate portfolio quality (89.0% committed occupancy), but is significantly constrained by weak interest coverage (1.80x) and an unsustainable distribution policy (AFFO payout ratio of 176.5%). While the ongoing asset disposition program and deleveraging strategy are credit positive, the REIT faces near-term execution risk and requires aggressive distribution reduction to achieve financial sustainability. The credit trajectory is highly dependent on successful asset monetization at or near book value and management's willingness to right-size distributions to preserve capital.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. **Leverage positioning:** Debt/Assets of 41.3% sits in the middle of the Baa range, providing moderate buffer
2. **Critical coverage weakness:** NOI/Interest coverage of 1.80x is well below investment grade thresholds (3.0x+)
3. **Unsustainable distribution policy:** AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% depletes retained capital and constrains financial flexibility
4. **Active deleveraging strategy:** Asset sales program targeting value realization and debt reduction

---

## Credit Strengths

1. **Moderate Leverage with Deleveraging Momentum**
   Debt/Gross Assets of 41.3% and Net Debt Ratio of 40.7% position Artis in the middle of the Baa range (35-45% typical). The active asset monetization program—including $4.75M of retail property sales in Q2 2025 with additional dispositions under evaluation—demonstrates commitment to balance sheet strengthening. The REIT's stated goal of selling assets "at or above IFRS values" suggests disciplined capital allocation.

2. **Solid Portfolio Occupancy Despite Market Headwinds**
   Committed occupancy of 89.0% (physical occupancy: 87.8%) reflects stable tenant demand across the 9.5M SF portfolio. The 1.2 percentage point occupancy buffer from signed but not yet commenced leases provides near-term NOI visibility and demonstrates effective leasing execution.

3. **Diversified Asset Class Exposure Reduces Concentration Risk**
   The REIT's multi-asset class portfolio (industrial, office, retail) provides diversification benefits relative to single-sector peers. This reduces exposure to asset-class-specific downturns, though diversified REITs typically trade at a complexity discount relative to focused peers.

4. **Adequate Liquidity Position for Near-Term Obligations**
   With ongoing asset sales generating cash proceeds and access to Normal Course Issuer Bid ("NCIB") as a capital management tool, Artis maintains flexibility to manage near-term debt maturities and operational needs, though distribution sustainability remains the primary liquidity concern.

5. **Established TSX-Listed REIT with Track Record**
   Listed on Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: AX.UN) and OTCQX (ARESF) with 96.6M common units outstanding, Artis maintains public market access and reporting transparency, supporting ongoing access to capital markets when market conditions permit.

## Credit Challenges

1. **Critically Weak Interest Coverage (1.80x)**
   NOI/Interest coverage of 1.80x falls well below investment grade standards (Baa: 3.0-4.0x; A: 4.0-6.0x). With annualized interest expense of $137.5M against property NOI, the REIT has minimal buffer to absorb NOI volatility or interest rate increases. This coverage level is consistent with Ba category (2.0-3.0x), significantly constraining the rating.

2. **Unsustainable Distribution Policy Depleting Financial Flexibility**
   The AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is fundamentally unsustainable, requiring the REIT to distribute $1.77 for every $1.00 of adjusted cash flow generated. This policy forces reliance on asset sales, debt issuance, or equity raises to fund distributions, eroding unitholder value over time. Even the FFO payout ratio of 88.2% provides minimal retained cash flow for capital recycling or debt reduction. **This represents the single most critical credit weakness.**

3. **Asset Disposition Execution Risk**
   The deleveraging strategy depends on successfully monetizing assets "at or above IFRS values" in a challenging commercial real estate environment marked by elevated cap rates and reduced buyer appetite. Failure to achieve targeted pricing would necessitate larger asset sales volumes, accelerating portfolio run-off and potentially requiring fire-sale pricing.

4. **Limited Same-Property NOI Growth (0.0%)**
   Flat same-property NOI growth indicates absence of organic portfolio value creation. Without positive rental rate growth or occupancy gains, the REIT cannot grow its way out of leverage or coverage challenges, placing full burden on external disposition proceeds.

5. **DBRS Credit Rating Discontinued Following Debenture Repayment**
   The discontinuation of DBRS ratings for senior unsecured debentures and preferred units following Q2 2025 debt repayment removes an independent credit assessment signal and may reduce transparency for fixed-income investors, potentially increasing future cost of capital.

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

**OUTLOOK: NEGATIVE**

The Negative outlook reflects significant execution risk associated with the asset disposition program and fundamental unsustainability of the current distribution policy. Over the next 12-18 months, Artis faces a critical inflection point:

**Rationale:**
- **Distribution Policy Unsustainability:** The 176.5% AFFO payout ratio cannot persist without destroying unitholder value through forced asset sales or equity dilution. Absent a meaningful distribution reduction (50%+ cut required to achieve ~80% AFFO payout), the REIT will continue to deplete balance sheet capacity.

- **Coverage Remains Below Investment Grade:** With 1.80x interest coverage, Artis has minimal cushion to absorb property-level NOI volatility, tenant defaults, or interest rate pressures. Even moderate EBITDA degradation (10-15%) would push coverage toward distressed levels (<1.5x).

- **Asset Sale Execution Critical:** The deleveraging pathway requires successful monetization of $100-300M+ of assets at or near book value over the next 12-18 months. Commercial real estate transaction volumes remain suppressed, and office assets in particular face valuation headwinds.

- **Positive Counterbalances (Insufficient to Offset):** The moderate leverage level (41.3% Debt/Assets) and active asset management provide some offset, but these factors are insufficient to overcome the fundamental distribution/coverage mismatch.

**Outlook could stabilize to Stable if:**
- Distribution reduced to 80-90% of AFFO (requiring ~50% distribution cut)
- Asset sales of $150M+ completed at/above book value with proceeds applied to debt reduction
- Interest coverage improves toward 2.5x through NOI growth and/or debt reduction

**Outlook could worsen to Developing if:**
- Asset sales delayed or completed materially below book value (10%+ discount)
- Coverage deteriorates below 1.5x due to NOI declines or refinancing at higher rates
- Distribution maintained at current unsustainable levels, forcing dilutive equity raises

**Stabilization Criteria:** Not specified

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

**Rating improvement to BBB (solid investment grade) would require:**

| Metric | Current | BBB Threshold | Improvement Required |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | 1.80x | 3.0-4.0x | +67% to +122% |
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | 41.3% | 35-40% | -130 to -340 bps |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 176.5% | 75-85% | -910 to -1,010 bps |
| **Same-Property NOI Growth** | 0.0% | 2.0-3.0% | +200 to +300 bps |

**Operational improvements needed:**
1. **Distribution reset to sustainable levels:** Cut distribution by 50-60% to achieve 80% AFFO payout ratio, retaining capital for debt reduction and portfolio investment
2. **Deleveraging through asset sales:** Execute $200-300M of non-core dispositions at or above book value, applying 100% of proceeds to debt reduction
3. **Organic NOI growth:** Drive 2-3% annual same-property NOI growth through rental rate increases, occupancy gains, and operating expense management
4. **Interest expense reduction:** Refinance maturing debt at favorable rates and reduce absolute debt load to lower annual interest expense by 20-25%
5. **Portfolio quality enhancement:** Increase committed occupancy to 92%+ and improve tenant credit quality through selective leasing

**Pathway to BBB (18-24 month timeframe):**
- Year 1: Cut distribution 50%, execute $150M asset sales, apply proceeds to debt reduction → Debt/Assets to 38%, Coverage to 2.2x
- Year 2: Generate 2.5% same-property NOI growth, refinance $100M at lower rates → Coverage to 2.8x, AFFO payout to 75%
- Result: BBB- rating achievable with sustained execution

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

**Rating pressure to BB or below would result from:**

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | <1.50x | 1.80x | 16.7% |
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | >50% | 41.3% | 870 bps |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | >200% | 176.5% | 2,350 bps |
| **Occupancy Rate** | <80% | 89.0% | 900 bps |

**Downgrade scenarios:**

1. **Asset Sale Execution Failure (High Probability: 30-40%)**
   - Assets sold at 10-15% discount to book value
   - Transaction volumes fall short of $100M target
   - Forced to retain higher-leverage profile (Debt/Assets >45%)
   - **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to BB

2. **Coverage Deterioration (Moderate Probability: 20-25%)**
   - Tenant defaults reduce NOI by 10-15%
   - Interest expense increases 15-20% due to refinancing at higher rates
   - Coverage falls to 1.4-1.5x range
   - **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to BB-

3. **Distribution Maintenance Without Asset Sales (Low Probability: 10-15%)**
   - Management maintains 176.5% AFFO payout without offsetting asset sales
   - Forced to issue equity at significant discount (20%+ dilution)
   - Balance sheet capacity erodes; covenant headroom tightens
   - **Rating Impact:** Downgrade to BB- with Negative outlook

4. **Covenant Breach or Liquidity Crisis (Low Probability: 5-10%)**
   - Unable to refinance maturing debt ($100M+ coming due)
   - Breach of debt/asset or coverage covenants
   - Forced asset liquidation at distressed pricing
   - **Rating Impact:** Multi-notch downgrade to B+ or below

**Early warning indicators:**
- Quarterly NOI decline >5% vs. prior year
- Asset sale announcements at >5% discount to last reported IFRS value
- Debt refinancing announcements with >100bps spread increase
- Distribution maintained or increased despite cash flow deterioration
- Covenant disclosure showing <10% headroom

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Small-Mid Cap REIT | **Ba** | Gross assets of $2.61B place Artis in the $2-5B range, consistent with Ba category. Lacks scale advantages of larger REITs (>$10B) but sufficient for market access. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Moderate Quality, Diversified Portfolio | **Baa** | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Diversified across industrial, office, retail with 89.0% committed occupancy. Portfolio lacks trophy-asset concentration but demonstrates operational stability. **Market Characteristics (12.5%):** Exposure to Canadian commercial real estate markets with cyclical characteristics; diversification reduces single-sector risk but creates complexity. Combined: Baa assessment. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Adequate but Constrained | **Ba** | TSX and OTCQX listings provide public equity access, but 176.5% AFFO payout and discontinued DBRS rating limit financing flexibility. Asset sales provide near-term liquidity but constrain long-term growth capacity. Refinancing risk manageable but elevated given coverage weakness. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Mixed: Moderate Leverage, Weak Coverage | **Ba** | **Debt/Gross Assets (41.3%):** Sits in middle of Baa range (35-45%), earning Baa sub-score. **NOI/Interest Coverage (1.80x):** Falls in Ba range (2.0-3.0x), earning Ba sub-score. Weighted toward coverage given its criticality: **Overall Ba**. This is the most heavily weighted factor and drives the overall rating. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | Aggressive and Unsustainable | **B** | AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is fundamentally unsustainable and reflects very aggressive financial policy prioritizing distribution maintenance over balance sheet preservation. Asset sales being used to fund distributions rather than growth or meaningful deleveraging. FFO payout of 88.2% provides minimal retained capital. Consistent with B category (very aggressive, high financial risk appetite). |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Weighted Average** | **Ba+/BB+** | **Indicated rating: BB+ (Upper Non-Investment Grade)**. Leverage & Coverage factor (35% weight at Ba) and Financial Policy (15% weight at B) pull overall score down despite moderate Business Profile (Baa). Scale (Ba) and Access to Capital (Ba) provide limited offset. **Rating range: BB+ to BBB-**, acknowledging deleveraging momentum could support BBB- if execution succeeds, but current coverage and distribution policy argue for BB+ baseline. |

**Scorecard Calibration Notes:**
- The 35% weight on Leverage & Coverage appropriately captures the critical nature of the 1.80x coverage weakness
- Financial Policy scoring at B (very aggressive) reflects the unsustainable 176.5% AFFO payout—this is not a policy designed to preserve credit quality
- Business Profile at Baa provides some offset given the diversified, operationally stable portfolio
- Final rating of BB+/BBB- reflects the transition state: current metrics argue for BB+, but successful deleveraging path could support BBB-

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**FFO and AFFO Performance:**
- **FFO of $34.5M ($0.34/unit)** represents the REIT's core operating cash flow before distributions
- **AFFO of $16.9M ($0.17/unit)** reflects a 51% decline from FFO, indicating significant non-discretionary capital expenditures, straight-line rent adjustments, or other AFFO adjustments
- The large FFO-to-AFFO gap (50%+ reduction) suggests either heavy maintenance capex requirements or significant non-cash adjustments, warranting further investigation of portfolio sustainability

**Distribution Coverage Crisis:**
- **Distributions of $0.30/unit** exceed AFFO of $0.17/unit by 76%, requiring external funding sources
- Even against FFO ($0.34/unit), distributions represent 88.2% payout, leaving minimal retained cash flow
- **This distribution level is mathematically unsustainable** without continuous asset sales or dilutive equity issuance
- Management's continued distribution at this level signals either (a) confidence in near-term asset sale proceeds, or (b) reluctance to deliver negative signal to market via distribution cut

**Portfolio Metrics Assessment:**
- **GLA of 9.5M SF** provides sufficient scale for operating efficiency but lacks the 15-20M+ SF scale of larger sector-focused REITs
- **89.0% committed occupancy** (vs. 87.8% physical) shows 120bps of near-term lease commencements, providing modest NOI tailwind
- **0.0% same-property NOI growth** is concerning—suggests inability to drive organic rental rate growth or occupancy gains within existing portfolio
- Zero NOI growth indicates the portfolio is running in place, placing full deleveraging burden on external asset sales rather than internal cash flow growth

### Unusual Ratios and Trends

1. **Coverage Below 2.0x is Rare for Investment Grade REITs:**
   The 1.80x NOI/Interest coverage would typically be associated with Ba/BB ratings. Investment grade REITs generally maintain 2.5-3.5x minimum coverage. This single metric is the primary constraint on rating upside.

2. **AFFO Payout Exceeding 150% Signals Distress or Transition:**
   AFFO payout ratios above 100% are inherently unsustainable. Ratios exceeding 150% typically indicate either (a) temporary distributions maintained during portfolio repositioning, or (b) financial distress. Artis appears to be in category (a) based on active asset sales, but prolonged maintenance of this payout would shift toward category (b).

3. **Flat Same-Property NOI Despite 89% Occupancy:**
   With near-90% occupancy, one would expect positive same-property NOI growth from rental rate increases or contractual escalations. 0.0% growth suggests either declining rental rates, higher operating expenses offsetting revenue growth, or portfolio turnover obscuring underlying trends. This bears close monitoring.

4. **Large FFO-to-AFFO Adjustment (50% reduction):**
   The $17.5M difference between FFO ($34.5M) and AFFO ($16.9M) is substantial. Typical AFFO adjustments range from 10-25% of FFO for maintenance capex and leasing costs. A 50% reduction suggests either deferred maintenance requirements, significant lease transaction costs, or aggressive non-cash income recognition in FFO. This warrants detailed reconciliation review.

### Quality of Financial Reporting

- **DBRS rating discontinued in Q2 2025** following senior unsecured debenture repayment removes third-party credit validation
- REIT continues to report non-GAAP metrics (FFO, AFFO, NAV, Adjusted EBITDA) consistent with REALPAC/NAREIT best practices
- Quarterly MD&A provides detailed portfolio metrics, leasing activity, and debt maturity schedules
- **Transparency is adequate** for credit assessment, though loss of external rating is a negative signal

## Peer Comparison

To contextualize Artis REIT's credit metrics, I researched comparable Canadian REITs with similar characteristics (diversified or office-focused, publicly traded, mid-cap scale). The following analysis compares Artis to three peers using Q2 2025 financial data where available.

### Peer Selection Criteria

**Peers selected:**
1. **Dream Office REIT** - Office-focused Canadian REIT, TSX-listed, comparable scale ($2.3B assets vs. Artis $2.6B)
2. **Allied Properties REIT** - Urban workspace/office REIT, larger scale but facing similar office market headwinds
3. **H&R REIT** - Diversified REIT (residential, industrial, office, retail), larger scale ($9.9B assets) but provides diversified peer benchmark

All three peers are Canadian REITs with Q2 2025 reported results, providing contemporaneous comparison.

### Peer Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Artis REIT | Dream Office | Allied Properties | H&R REIT | Peer Average |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Total Assets** | $2.61B | $2.30B | ~$5.0B (est.) | $9.90B | $5.73B |
| **Debt/Assets** | 41.3% | ~52% (est.)¹ | 44.0% | 45.5%² | 47.2% |
| **Interest Coverage** | 1.80x | Not disclosed³ | Not disclosed⁴ | Not disclosed⁵ | N/A |
| **FFO per Unit (Q2)** | $0.34 | $0.62 | Not disclosed | $0.61 | $0.62 |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | 176.5% | Not disclosed | Not disclosed | ~98%⁶ | N/A |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 89.0% | Not disclosed | 87.2% | Not disclosed | 87.2% |
| **Same-Property NOI Growth** | 0.0% | Not disclosed | +1.5% | +3.4% | +2.5% |

### Comparative Analysis

**Where Artis Ranks Relative to Peers:**

1. **Leverage (Debt/Assets: 41.3%)**
   **Ranking: 1st (Lowest leverage)**
   Artis maintains the lowest debt-to-assets ratio among peers, providing a competitive advantage. Dream Office at ~52% and H&R REIT at 45.5% carry materially higher leverage. This positions Artis favorably for deleveraging execution.

2. **FFO per Unit ($0.34 in Q2 2025)**
   **Ranking: 4th (Lowest among disclosed peers)**
   Dream Office ($0.62) and H&R REIT ($0.61) generate nearly 2x the FFO per unit, though Dream Office experienced a $0.14 decline from Q2 2024. Artis's lower FFO/unit reflects smaller scale and potentially weaker portfolio productivity.

3. **Occupancy (89.0% committed)**
   **Ranking: 2nd (Slightly higher than Allied at 87.2%)**
   Artis's 89.0% committed occupancy compares favorably to Allied Properties' 87.2%, though both trail typical high-performing REIT benchmarks of 92-95%. Allied is targeting 90% occupancy by year-end 2025, suggesting similar positioning.

4. **Same-Property NOI Growth (0.0%)**
   **Ranking: 4th (Worst performer)**
   Artis's flat same-property NOI growth significantly lags H&R REIT (+3.4%) and Allied Properties (+1.5%). This indicates Artis is not capturing organic growth from its existing portfolio, placing full deleveraging burden on asset sales.

5. **AFFO Payout Ratio (176.5%)**
   **Ranking: Cannot determine peer ranking** (insufficient peer disclosure)
   However, estimated H&R REIT payout of ~98% suggests Artis is an extreme outlier. A 176.5% payout is unsustainable by any standard and represents the most significant negative differentiator versus peers.

**Rating Positioning Assessment:**

Given the available peer data, Artis's **BB+ indicated rating appears appropriate** relative to peer positioning:

- **Dream Office REIT:** Higher leverage (~52% vs. 41.3%) and declining FFO (-18% YoY) suggest similar or weaker credit profile despite larger FFO/unit. Likely rated in BB to BBB- range.

- **Allied Properties REIT:** Net debt-to-EBITDA of 11.9x is extremely elevated (target <10x by year-end), suggesting significant credit stress. However, higher same-property NOI growth (+1.5%) and active deleveraging program provide upside pathway. Likely rated BB- to BB.

- **H&R REIT:** Larger scale ($9.9B assets), strong same-property NOI growth (+3.4%), lower estimated AFFO payout (~98%), and manageable leverage (45.5%) suggest stronger credit profile. Likely rated BBB- to BBB.

**Key Differentiators:**

**What Separates Artis from Higher-Rated Peers (H&R REIT):**
- **Scale:** Artis ($2.6B assets) lacks the $10B+ scale of H&R, limiting operating leverage and capital access
- **Organic Growth:** 0.0% same-property NOI growth vs. H&R's +3.4% eliminates internal deleveraging capacity
- **Distribution Discipline:** 176.5% AFFO payout vs. H&R's estimated 98% reflects aggressive/unsustainable policy
- **Coverage:** 1.80x interest coverage (Artis) vs. undisclosed but likely higher for H&R given better operating performance

**What Separates Artis from Lower-Rated Peers (Allied Properties):**
- **Leverage:** Artis's 41.3% Debt/Assets is materially better than Allied's 44% with 11.9x Net Debt/EBITDA
- **Deleveraging Clarity:** Artis has simpler asset sale program vs. Allied's complex repositioning
- **Occupancy:** Artis's 89.0% modestly exceeds Allied's 87.2%, though both are sub-optimal

**Conclusion:**
Artis REIT's **BB+ to BBB- rating positioning** is appropriate given peer comparisons. The REIT benefits from lower leverage than most peers but is significantly disadvantaged by zero organic growth and an unsustainable distribution policy. Successful execution of the asset sale program with concurrent distribution reduction could support BBB- (lower investment grade), while execution failure or continued distribution at 176.5% of AFFO would justify BB or below.

Based on management's stated objectives in the Q2 2025 MD&A and observable financial metrics, Artis is executing a **portfolio repositioning and balance sheet strengthening strategy** with the following key elements:

### Stated Strategic Vision

**"Become a best-in-class real estate asset management and investment platform focused on value investing."**

Artis's strategy centers on generating long-term growth in net asset value (NAV) per unit through three pillars:
1. **Strengthening the balance sheet** (deleveraging)
2. **Driving organic growth** (operational improvements)
3. **Value investing** (opportunistic capital allocation)

The REIT aims to "concentrate its ownership in the highest and best risk-adjusted return opportunities in an effort to maximize long-term value for unitholders."

### Strategic Initiatives (Q2 2025 Update)

#### 1. Dispositions (Portfolio Monetization)

**Execution:**
- Q2 2025: Sold one retail property in Canada for $4.75M
- Ongoing: "Continue to evaluate the sale of a portion of its industrial, office and retail assets in an opportunistic and disciplined manner"
- **Goal:** Sell assets at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values, maximizing value on a tax-efficient basis

**Credit Interpretation:**
This is a **harvest/reposition strategy** focused on unlocking value from non-core or mature assets. The emphasis on selling "at or above IFRS values" indicates management prioritizes pricing discipline over transaction velocity, which is credit positive but introduces execution risk in a challenging transaction environment.

#### 2. Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)

**Activity:**
- NCIB renewed effective December 19, 2024
- Authorized to purchase up to 4,975,917 common units, 291,560 Series E preferred units, and 421,775 Series I preferred units
- Artis views NCIB as "a valuable tool to enhance unitholder value"

**Credit Interpretation:**
NCIB provides flexibility for opportunistic unit buybacks when trading below NAV, potentially enhancing per-unit metrics. However, capital deployed to buybacks competes with debt reduction and distribution funding. Given the 176.5% AFFO payout ratio, significant NCIB activity would be credit negative unless funded entirely by asset sale proceeds.

#### 3. Operations and Developments (Organic Growth)

**Focus:**
MD&A states "Organic growth is an important element of Artis's strategy" with management "focused on identifying operational improvements."

**Credit Interpretation:**
The stated focus on organic growth is not reflected in current metrics—0.0% same-property NOI growth indicates the REIT is not yet successfully driving rental rate increases or occupancy gains. This suggests organic growth is an aspiration rather than current achievement. Execution of this pillar is critical to rating upside.

#### 4. Strategic Value Investments

**Status:**
This initiative is mentioned in the business strategy section but not elaborated in Q2 2025 MD&A, suggesting it is not currently an active priority.

**Credit Interpretation:**
In the context of weak coverage (1.80x) and unsustainable distributions (176.5% AFFO payout), deploying capital to "strategic value investments" would be credit negative unless these investments generate immediate accretive returns well above the cost of capital.

#### 5. Credit Rating Status

**Update:**
Following the repayment of Artis's senior unsecured debentures during Q2 2025, DBRS discontinued ratings for both the senior unsecured debentures and the REIT's preferred trust units.

**Credit Interpretation:**
The debenture repayment is credit positive (debt reduction), but loss of DBRS rating removes third-party credit validation and may increase future cost of capital if Artis seeks to return to unsecured debt markets.

### Strategy Classification and Credit Implications

**Primary Strategy Type: REPOSITION / HARVEST**

Based on the combination of:
- Active asset monetization program (dispositions)
- High distribution payout maintained (176.5% AFFO, 88.2% FFO)
- Flat same-property NOI growth (0.0%)
- Balance sheet focus (debt reduction from asset sales)
- No disclosed acquisition activity

Artis is executing a **harvest/reposition strategy** characterized by:
- Monetizing mature or non-core assets
- Returning capital to unitholders via distributions (though at unsustainable levels)
- Selectively retaining highest-quality, best-performing assets
- Reducing portfolio complexity and improving focus

**This strategy is appropriate given:**
- Moderate leverage requiring deleveraging
- Weak interest coverage necessitating debt reduction
- Commercial real estate market challenges favoring selective portfolio concentration
- Lack of organic growth opportunities in current portfolio

**Key Execution Risk:**
Success depends on achieving asset sale pricing at or above book value. If forced to accept material discounts (10%+), the strategy would fail to deliver NAV preservation and could trigger rating downgrades.

### Comparison to Typical REIT Strategies

**vs. Growth Strategy:**
Artis is NOT pursuing growth (acquisitions, development, expansion). Zero same-property NOI growth and asset sales confirm this is a consolidation phase, not expansion.

**vs. Harvest Strategy:**
Artis exhibits some harvest characteristics (high payout, asset sales) but the 176.5% AFFO payout exceeds typical harvest models (80-95% payout), suggesting distribution is not yet right-sized for steady-state operations.

**vs. Value Strategy:**
While management articulates "value investing" vision, current execution is defensive (selling assets, reducing debt) rather than offensive (acquiring discounted assets). This may represent a transition phase before pivoting to value investing once balance sheet is strengthened.

**Credit Opinion on Strategy:**
The repositioning strategy is **appropriate and necessary** given current credit metrics, but **execution is incomplete**. Management must complete three critical steps to validate the strategy:

1. **Execute $150-250M of asset sales at/near book value** (proves portfolio quality)
2. **Reduce distribution by 40-50%** (achieves sustainable 80-90% AFFO payout)
3. **Demonstrate organic NOI growth of 2%+** (validates remaining portfolio quality)

Until these steps are completed, the strategy remains **in transition with material execution risk**.

## Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

### Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case (50-60% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of $100-150M completed over next 12 months at 95-100% of book value
- Occupancy stabilizes at 88-90% range with modest positive leasing spreads
- Same-property NOI growth improves to +1.0% to +1.5% annually through rental rate increases
- Distribution reduced by 30-40% to $0.18-0.21/unit (AFFO payout to 110-125%)
- Interest rates remain elevated; refinancing occurs at current market rates (no significant spread widening)

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 38.5% (from 41.3%) - $120M debt reduction from asset sales
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 9.5x (from ~10.5x est.) - modest improvement from debt paydown and NOI growth
- **Interest Coverage:** 2.0x (from 1.80x) - 11% improvement from debt reduction lowering interest expense
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 115% (from 176.5%) - still unsustainable but materially improved

**Rating Impact:** **Stable at BB+**
Modest deleveraging and distribution reduction demonstrate positive credit trajectory but insufficient to achieve investment grade. Coverage remains below 2.5x threshold and AFFO payout still exceeds 100%. Outlook could improve to Stable from Negative.

### Upside Case (20-30% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Successful asset sales of $250-300M at or above book value over 12-18 months
- Occupancy improves to 92%+ driven by strong leasing momentum and market recovery
- Same-property NOI growth accelerates to +2.5% to +3.0% annually
- Distribution cut by 50% to $0.15/unit (AFFO payout to 80-85%)
- Modest interest rate decline allows refinancing at 50-75bps below current rates

**Pro Forma Metrics (18 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 35.0% (from 41.3%) - $250M debt reduction moves into A category range
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 8.0x (from ~10.5x) - significant improvement
- **Interest Coverage:** 2.7x (from 1.80x) - 50% improvement from debt reduction and NOI growth
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 82% (from 176.5%) - achieves sustainable distribution policy

**Rating Impact:** **Upgrade to BBB- (Lower Investment Grade)**
Aggressive deleveraging combined with sustainable distribution policy and improving coverage would support investment grade rating. Key requirements: (1) distribution cut of 50% demonstrates financial discipline, (2) asset sales at/above book validate portfolio quality, (3) organic NOI growth reduces reliance on external funding.

**Probability Assessment:** 20-30% probability reflects significant execution challenges including unitholder acceptance of 50% distribution cut, sustained asset sale market, and operational improvements.

### Downside Case (10-20% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Asset sales of only $50-75M due to weak transaction market, completed at 85-90% of book value (10-15% discount)
- Occupancy declines to 84-86% due to tenant defaults or non-renewals
- Same-property NOI declines -2.0% to -3.0% from lower occupancy and rental rate concessions
- Distribution maintained at current $0.30/unit level (AFFO payout remains >175%)
- One or more major tenants (representing 3-5% of GLA) default during lease term

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 42.5% (from 41.3%) - minimal debt reduction; write-down on sold assets increases ratio
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 11.5x (from ~10.5x) - deterioration from NOI decline
- **Interest Coverage:** 1.55x (from 1.80x) - 14% decline from lower NOI and sustained interest expense
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** 190%+ (from 176.5%) - worsening from AFFO decline

**Rating Impact:** **Downgrade to BB (Mid Non-Investment Grade)**
Coverage falling toward 1.5x combined with failed asset sale execution and unsustainable distribution policy would trigger downgrade. Covenant headroom would tighten materially, increasing refinancing risk.

### Stress Case (5-10% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Recession scenario: NOI declines 12-15% from combination of tenant defaults, occupancy falling to 78-80%, and rental rate concessions
- Unable to execute meaningful asset sales (total <$25M) due to frozen transaction market; forced to retain high-leverage portfolio
- Unable to refinance maturing debt ($100M+ coming due); potential covenant breach on debt/asset or coverage tests
- Credit facility access restricted; forced to negotiate waiver or amendment with lenders
- Distribution suspended entirely to preserve liquidity

**Pro Forma Metrics (12 months forward):**
- **Debt/Assets:** 47%+ (from 41.3%) - asset write-downs with minimal debt reduction
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 14x+ (from ~10.5x) - severe deterioration
- **Interest Coverage:** 1.2x (from 1.80x) - approaching distressed levels
- **AFFO Payout Ratio:** N/A (distribution suspended)

**Rating Impact:** **Multi-notch downgrade to B+ or B (High Yield / Distressed)**
Covenant breach risk, liquidity constraints, and coverage below 1.5x would signal material credit distress. Potential outcomes include forced asset liquidation, distressed refinancing, or balance sheet restructuring.

**Probability Assessment:** 5-10% reflects tail risk of severe recession combined with frozen capital markets. Current moderate leverage (41.3%) and diversified portfolio provide some buffer, but weak coverage leaves minimal cushion.

### Downgrade Trigger Summary

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Buffer | Scenario Most Likely to Breach |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Net Debt/EBITDA** | >12.0x | ~10.5x (est.) | ~14% | Downside / Stress Case |
| **Interest Coverage** | <1.50x | 1.80x | 16.7% | Downside / Stress Case |
| **Debt/Assets** | >50% | 41.3% | 21% | Stress Case only |
| **Occupancy** | <80% | 89.0% | 10% | Stress Case only |
| **AFFO Payout** | >200% | 176.5% | 13% | Downside Case (if distribution maintained) |

**Key Observations:**
- **Interest coverage has minimal buffer** (16.7% to breach threshold) and is the most vulnerable metric in Downside scenario
- **Debt/Assets has substantial buffer** (21% to breach) due to conservative starting leverage position
- **Distribution policy** is the primary variable—maintaining current payout in deteriorating environment would rapidly consume balance sheet capacity

**Most Likely Path Forward (Base Case):**
Management executes $100-150M of asset sales, reduces distribution by 30-40%, achieves modest NOI growth, and stabilizes at BB+ rating with Stable outlook over 12-18 months. This path requires threading the needle between unitholder distribution expectations and credit preservation.
