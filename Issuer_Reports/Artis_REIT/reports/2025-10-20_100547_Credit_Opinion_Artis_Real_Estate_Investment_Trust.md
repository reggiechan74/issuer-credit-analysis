# Credit Opinion: Artis Real Estate Investment Trust

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Reporting Period:** Q2 2025
**Currency:** CAD

---

## Executive Summary

Artis REIT is a diversified commercial real estate investment trust undergoing strategic portfolio transformation through asset monetization and repositioning. With gross assets of $2.61 billion across 83 properties (9.7 million SF) in Canada and the United States, the REIT operates across industrial, office, retail, and residential asset classes. The credit profile reflects elevated leverage (52.5% Debt/Assets), weak interest coverage (1.81x NOI/Interest), and an unsustainable distribution policy (187.5% AFFO payout ratio), offset partially by minimal dilution risk, strategic asset sales progress, and enhanced governance disclosure.

---

## Credit Strengths

**Quantified Positive Factors:**

1. **Minimal Share Dilution Demonstrates Disciplined Capital Allocation**
   Share dilution of 2.01% (1,500 restricted units + 500 deferred units = 2,000 dilutive units vs. 99,444 basic units) is within the "low materiality" range (1-3%) and reflects normal equity compensation practices. Critically, there are zero convertible debentures outstanding, eliminating forced conversion risk and potential debt-like equity overhang. This compares favorably to REITs with material convertible positions (5-10% dilution) that constrain debt capacity and create balance sheet uncertainty.

2. **Enhanced Governance and Disclosure Transparency**
   Detailed dilution breakdown in Q2 2025 MD&A (page 21) showing instrument-by-instrument reconciliation (RSUs: 1,500 units, DSUs: 500 units, calculated dilution: 2.01% matching reported dilution) demonstrates superior disclosure practices relative to peers reporting only basic/diluted unit totals. Enhanced transparency supports credit analysis and reflects strong governance culture.

3. **Diversified Asset Class and Geographic Exposure Reduces Concentration Risk**
   Portfolio spans four asset classes (industrial, office, retail, residential) across Canada and United States markets, mitigating single-sector downturns. Diversification supports occupancy maintenance during individual market stress, though concentration in office assets (primary NOI contributor per portfolio mix) creates exposure to structural office sector headwinds.

4. **Strategic Asset Sales at/Above Book Value Support NAV Protection**
   Q2 2025 retail disposition ($4.75M sale price) executed as part of value-maximization strategy. Management's stated goal of selling assets "at or above IFRS Accounting Standards values" on a tax-efficient basis, if achieved, protects net asset value per unit and supports deleveraging without equity dilution. Continued execution critical to credit story.

5. **Positive Same-Property NOI Growth Indicates Operational Stability**
   Same-property NOI growth of 2.3% (annualized) demonstrates ability to achieve rent increases and occupancy gains despite competitive markets. While modest, positive organic growth supports AFFO generation and partially offsets distribution burden.

## Credit Challenges

**Quantified Risk Factors:**

1. **Severely Unsustainable Distribution Policy Forces Capital Markets Reliance**
   AFFO payout ratio of 187.5% means the REIT distributes $1.875 for every $1.00 of adjusted funds from operations generated. With AFFO of $8.2M (annualized: ~$16.4M) and distributions of $0.15/unit (99,444 units = $14.9M annualized), the REIT must fund ~$14.3M annually through asset sales, debt issuance, or equity raises. This creates:
   - **Forced asset sale risk:** Must monetize properties even in weak markets to fund distributions
   - **Refinancing pressure:** Requires continuous capital markets access
   - **Equity dilution risk:** May need to issue units at depressed valuations if asset sales stall

   **Mitigant:** NCIB (Normal Course Issuer Bid) renewed December 2024 provides distribution management flexibility, but suspension/cut would signal distress to market.

2. **Below-Grade Interest Coverage Creates Covenant and Refinancing Vulnerability**
   NOI/Interest coverage of 1.81x compares unfavorably to:
   - **Investment grade minimum:** 3.0x+ for Baa rating
   - **High-yield REIT typical:** 2.5-3.0x for Ba rating
   - **Distressed threshold:** <2.0x signals potential covenant breach risk

   With annualized interest expense of $67.7M and total debt of $1,370M, the REIT has minimal margin for EBITDA decline (15-20% NOI drop would push coverage below 1.5x). Weak coverage limits refinancing negotiating power and increases spread risk on debt rollovers.

3. **Occupancy Below Market Averages Signals Leasing Challenges**
   Portfolio occupancy of 87.8% (89.0% including commitments) trails:
   - **Industrial REIT sector:** ~95-97% typical
   - **Diversified REIT sector:** ~91-93% typical
   - **Office sector (urban):** ~88-92% typical

   Below-market occupancy suggests tenant retention challenges, competitive market positioning, or asset quality concerns. Each 100 bps of occupancy decline reduces NOI by ~$1-2M annually, further pressuring coverage ratios. Achieving management's 90%+ occupancy target requires successful lease-up of 210-220 bps (2.1-2.2 percentage points), representing material execution risk.

4. **Asset Sale Execution Risk in Weak Commercial Real Estate Markets**
   Q2 2025 saw only one disposition ($4.75M retail property) compared to implied annual target of $50-100M+ based on deleveraging needs. Weak transaction volumes in Canadian commercial real estate (particularly office) create risk that:
   - Asset sales occur below IFRS values, impairing NAV per unit
   - Sales stall entirely, forcing distribution cuts or equity raises
   - Fire sale pricing emerges if liquidity needs become acute

   **Downside scenario:** If asset sales fall 50% short of target, AFFO payout would exceed 200%, requiring immediate distribution cut or $20-30M equity raise.

## Rating Outlook

The Negative outlook reflects execution risk around Artis REIT's deleveraging strategy and unsustainable distribution policy over the next 12-18 months. Three scenarios drive outlook assessment:

**Base Case (60% probability): Rating Maintained at Ba2/BB**
Assumes:
- Asset sales of $75-125M over 12 months at 95-105% of book value
- Distribution maintained at $0.15/unit (~$15M annually) through asset sale proceeds
- Occupancy improvement to 89-91% through lease renewals and new commitments
- Same-property NOI growth sustained at 2-3%

**Pro forma deleveraging:**
- Asset sales of $100M less debt paydown of $75M → Debt/Assets improves to 49-50%
- NOI stable to +2% → Coverage improves to 1.85-1.90x
- AFFO payout ratio remains elevated at 170-180% (unsustainable but manageable near-term)

**Rating Impact:** Negative outlook maintained due to continued reliance on asset sales to fund distributions.

**Downside Case (30% probability): Downgrade to Ba3/BB-**
Triggers:
- Asset sales stall (<$50M over 12 months) due to market illiquidity
- Occupancy declines to 85-87% due to tenant non-renewals
- Same-property NOI contracts -1% to 0% due to rent concessions
- Distribution maintained, forcing $20-30M equity issuance at 15-20% discount to NAV

**Pro forma deterioration:**
- Minimal deleveraging → Debt/Assets remains 52-54%
- NOI decline + equity dilution → Coverage falls to 1.70-1.75x
- AFFO payout exceeds 200%, signaling distribution cut imminent

**Rating Impact:** Downgrade to Ba3 on weakened liquidity profile and increased financial risk.

**Upside Case (10% probability): Outlook Revised to Stable**
Triggers:
- Asset sales exceed $150M at 105-110% of book value
- Distribution cut to $0.10-0.12/unit (reducing payout to 125-150% of AFFO)
- Occupancy reaches 91-93% through successful leasing campaigns
- Same-property NOI growth accelerates to 3-4%

**Pro forma improvement:**
- Debt reduction of $100-125M → Debt/Assets improves to 47-48%
- NOI growth + lower distributions → Coverage improves to 2.0-2.2x
- AFFO payout ratio moves toward 140-150% (still elevated but improving trajectory)

**Rating Impact:** Outlook revised to Stable on improved financial flexibility and sustainable distribution policy.

**12-Month Forward View:**
Key monitoring metrics: quarterly asset sale volumes, distribution policy announcements, occupancy trends, and coverage ratio trajectory. A distribution cut announcement (positive for credit, negative for equity) would likely trigger Outlook revision to Stable if accompanied by meaningful deleveraging progress.

## Upgrade Factors

**Quantified Thresholds for Ba1/BB+ Rating:**

1. **Debt/Assets < 45%**
   Current: 52.5% → Requires $195M of debt reduction through asset sales or equity
   **Pathway:** Sell $250-300M of assets over 18-24 months at book value, deploy proceeds to debt paydown

2. **NOI/Interest Coverage > 2.5x**
   Current: 1.81x → Requires 38% NOI growth OR 28% interest expense reduction
   **Pathway:** Combination of (a) 10-15% NOI growth through occupancy gains + rent increases, (b) refinance $200-300M of debt at 50-75 bps lower rates, (c) modest distribution cut freeing $3-5M annually for debt paydown

3. **AFFO Payout Ratio < 90%**
   Current: 187.5% → Requires distribution cut to $0.07-0.08/unit OR doubling AFFO
   **Pathway:** Cut distribution to $0.08/unit (47% reduction), maintain through cycle, reinvest savings into debt reduction and portfolio quality improvements

4. **Occupancy Sustained > 92%**
   Current: 87.8% (89.0% with commitments) → Requires 420 bps improvement
   **Pathway:** Execute on existing lease commitments (+120 bps to 89.0%), achieve 300 bps additional through renewals and new leasing, demonstrate 12+ months of sustained >92% occupancy

5. **Track Record of Asset Sales at/Above Book Value**
   Current: Limited evidence (1 sale in Q2 2025)
   **Pathway:** Execute 6-8 dispositions over 12-18 months averaging 100-105% of IFRS values, demonstrating portfolio quality and management execution capability

**Timeframe:** 24-36 months of sustained improvement across all metrics required for upgrade. Near-term upgrade unlikely given current distribution policy and leverage levels.

## Downgrade Factors

**Quantified Trigger Points for B1/B+ Rating:**

1. **Debt/Assets > 55%**
   Current: 52.5% → Would occur if asset sales below book value or additional debt raised
   **Trigger Scenario:** $50M of asset sales at 85-90% of book value + $25M equity value write-down → Debt/Assets rises to 55-56%

2. **NOI/Interest Coverage < 1.5x**
   Current: 1.81x → Would occur with 17% NOI decline OR 20% interest expense increase
   **Trigger Scenario:** Major tenant default (100,000 SF at $20/SF = $2M NOI loss) + 100 bps refinancing rate increase on $500M of debt rollovers → Coverage falls to 1.45-1.50x

3. **AFFO Payout Ratio > 250%**
   Current: 187.5% → Would occur if AFFO declines 25% while distribution maintained
   **Trigger Scenario:** Same-property NOI contracts -5%, major capex requirement depletes AFFO by $2-3M → AFFO falls to $6M, payout rises to 248%

4. **Occupancy < 85%**
   Current: 87.8% → Would occur with 280 bps decline from tenant non-renewals
   **Trigger Scenario:** Office sector stress, 200,000 SF of non-renewals at quarter-end → Occupancy falls to 84-85%

5. **Covenant Breach or Liquidity Crisis**
   **Trigger Scenario:** Debt/Assets covenant typically 60-65% → Current 52.5% provides 7.5-12.5 point cushion, but rapid deterioration possible if forced to refinance in distressed conditions or asset sales stall entirely

6. **Distribution Suspension Without Credible Deleveraging Plan**
   **Trigger Scenario:** Distribution cut to $0 announced alongside minimal asset sale progress → Signals equity value impairment and inability to access capital markets, raises going-concern questions

**Near-Term Downgrade Risk (Next 6-12 Months):**
**Moderate (30% probability)** - primarily driven by asset sale execution risk and potential distribution policy crisis. Key watchpoints: Q3/Q4 2025 disposition volumes, lease expiry schedule management, and any refinancing announcements on debt maturing in 2025-2026.

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's-Style 5-Factor Scorecard for REITs

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Ba | **Ba** | Gross assets of $2.61B places Artis in Ba category ($2-5B range). Smaller scale limits capital markets access, refinancing negotiating power, and geographic/tenant diversification relative to larger REITs ($10B+ for A, $20B+ for Aa). Portfolio of 83 properties (9.7M SF) provides moderate scale but concentration risk remains. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Ba/B | **Ba-** | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Mixed portfolio quality with exposure to structurally challenged office sector. Occupancy of 87.8% trails sector averages (91-93% for diversified REITs), indicating secondary market positioning or older vintage assets. Some assets likely non-core (hence disposition strategy). **Market Characteristics (12.5%):** Diversified across Canada/U.S. and four asset classes (industrial, office, retail, residential) provides cyclical protection, but office exposure creates secular headwinds. Industrial and residential holdings positive; office and some retail challenged. Competitive markets with limited pricing power (2.3% same-property NOI growth). **Combined:** Ba- reflects below-average asset quality and competitive market positioning. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Ba | **Ba** | TSX listing (AX.UN) and OTCQX listing (ARESF) provide public market access, but weak unit price performance (implied by 187.5% payout ratio and asset sale strategy) constrains equity issuance capacity. NCIB active (renewed Dec 2024), suggesting management views units as undervalued. Debt markets accessible but likely at high-yield spreads given leverage and coverage metrics. Enhanced dilution disclosure (governance score: enhanced) is positive, but overall capital access constrained by financial profile. Refinancing risk moderate to high given weak coverage (1.81x). |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Ba | **Ba** | **Debt/Gross Assets: 52.5%** → Solidly Ba category (45-55% range), approaching B threshold (>55%). Net debt ratio of 51.8% similarly elevated. **NOI/Interest Coverage: 1.81x** → Below Ba range midpoint (2.0-3.0x target), closer to B category (<2.0x). Weak coverage is most concerning credit metric, indicating minimal cushion for NOI volatility or interest rate increases. **FFO Payout: 88.2%** → Manageable on FFO basis but misleading given AFFO payout of 187.5%. **Overall:** Ba score with negative bias due to weak coverage offsetting moderate leverage. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | B | **B** | Distribution policy is aggressively unsustainable (187.5% AFFO payout), requiring continuous asset sales or capital markets access to fund distributions. This signals **very aggressive financial risk appetite** characteristic of B-rated financial policy. Management's asset sale strategy aims to strengthen balance sheet, but maintaining distributions during deleveraging contradicts stated goals. Positive factors: (1) NCIB demonstrates willingness to manage distributions, (2) enhanced disclosure shows governance awareness, (3) no convertible debt limits forced dilution. However, current policy prioritizes distributions over balance sheet repair, placing in B category for financial policy despite Ba operational profile. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Ba2 / BB** | **Ba2** | **Indicated Rating: Ba2 (Moody's) / BB (S&P)** - Weighted scoring yields Ba2, reflecting (1) moderate scale, (2) below-average business profile, (3) constrained capital access, (4) elevated leverage with weak coverage, and (5) aggressive financial policy. Rating sits in high-yield speculative grade with primary risks being refinancing exposure and distribution sustainability. Positive rating momentum requires distribution cut and sustained deleveraging progress. |

**Rating Justification:**
Ba2/BB rating reflects a REIT with meaningful operational capabilities (diversified portfolio, public market access, positive NOI growth) offset by aggressive financial policy and elevated credit risk metrics. The rating balances Artis's real estate franchise value against near-term refinancing and distribution policy risks. This is a "prove it" rating requiring demonstration of deleveraging execution and financial policy discipline to achieve positive momentum.

**Key Rating Constraint:**
Financial Policy (B-rated) acts as primary rating constraint, preventing higher rating despite moderate operational profile. A distribution cut to sustainable levels (80-90% AFFO payout) would immediately improve scorecard to Ba1/BB+ range, assuming leverage and coverage metrics stabilize.

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**1. FFO vs. AFFO Divergence Signals Hidden Capital Intensity**

- **FFO:** $17.0M (Q2 2025, annualized basis)
- **AFFO:** $8.2M (Q2 2025, annualized basis)
- **Divergence:** AFFO is 48% of FFO, indicating $8.8M of adjustments

**Implication:** The REIT's business model requires significant ongoing capital investment (sustaining capex, tenant improvements, leasing costs) not captured in FFO. AFFO of $8.2M represents true distributable cash flow, making the 187.5% payout ratio even more concerning. Typical REITs see AFFO at 70-85% of FFO; Artis's 48% ratio suggests capital-intensive asset base or deferred maintenance requirements.

**Credit Impact:** Negative - indicates lower-quality cash flow sustainability and higher ongoing capital needs.

---

**2. Per-Unit Metrics Show Minimal Basic/Diluted Spread**

- **FFO per unit:** $0.17 (basic and diluted effectively equal given 2.01% dilution)
- **AFFO per unit:** $0.08 (basic and diluted effectively equal)
- **Distributions per unit:** $0.15

**Calculation Check:**
- Basic units: 99,444
- Diluted units: 101,444
- Dilution impact: 2,000 units / 99,444 = 2.01%
- Per-unit dilution effect: ~$0.003-0.005 per metric (immaterial)

**Implication:** Equity compensation structure (RSUs + DSUs) is non-dilutive to credit metrics. Unlike REITs with 8-10% dilution from convertible debentures, Artis's capital structure is straightforward with no material conversion overhang.

**Credit Impact:** Neutral to slightly positive - eliminates forced conversion scenarios and simplifies capital structure analysis.

---

**3. Portfolio Occupancy Composition Reveals Leasing Momentum**

- **In-place occupancy:** 87.8%
- **Committed occupancy:** 89.0%
- **Lease-up pipeline:** 120 bps (1.2 percentage points)

**Implication:** The 120 bps of committed-but-not-yet-occupied space represents near-term positive momentum. If commitments convert successfully, occupancy reaches 89.0% by Q3-Q4 2025, improving NOI by ~$1.0-1.5M annually. However, failure to convert commitments (tenant defaults, construction delays) would signal deeper leasing challenges.

**Watch Item:** Track Q3 2025 occupancy closely - should show movement toward 89% if commitments are real.

**Credit Impact:** Neutral - positive momentum offset by execution risk.

---

**4. Same-Property NOI Growth of 2.3% Lags Inflation**

- **Reported same-property NOI growth:** 2.3% (annualized)
- **Canadian CPI (2024-2025):** ~2.0-2.5%
- **Real NOI growth:** ~0-0.3% (nominal growth minus inflation)

**Implication:** Artis is barely keeping pace with inflation on a same-property basis, indicating limited pricing power. Strong REITs achieve 3-5% same-property NOI growth through rent escalations and occupancy gains. Artis's 2.3% suggests competitive markets, weak tenant demand, or portfolio mix challenges (office drag).

**Peer Comparison:**
- Industrial REITs: 4-6% same-property NOI growth typical
- Office REITs: -2% to +2% range (sector challenged)
- Diversified REITs: 2-4% typical

**Credit Impact:** Negative - indicates limited organic growth runway and reliance on acquisitions or asset quality improvements for NOI expansion.

---

**5. Interest Expense Run-Rate Analysis**

- **Q2 2025 interest expense:** $16.9M
- **Annualized (x4):** $67.7M
- **Total debt:** $1,369.6M
- **Implied interest rate:** 4.94%

**Implication:** Weighted average interest rate of ~4.9% is reasonable for 2025 environment (Government of Canada 5-year: ~3.0%, REIT credit spread: 150-200 bps = 4.5-5.0%). However, any refinancing at higher rates (if credit spreads widen or government rates rise) would pressure coverage further.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- +50 bps rate increase on $500M refinancing → +$2.5M annual interest → Coverage falls to 1.75x
- +100 bps rate increase on $500M refinancing → +$5.0M annual interest → Coverage falls to 1.68x

**Credit Impact:** Negative - limited cushion for rising rates given already weak coverage.

---

**6. Dilution Disclosure Excellence Signals Governance Quality**

- **Source:** Q2 2025 MD&A page 21 (explicit reference in metrics)
- **Content:** Instrument-by-instrument breakdown (RSUs: 1,500, DSUs: 500, options: 0, convertibles: 0, warrants: 0)
- **Reconciliation:** Calculated dilution (2.01%) matches reported dilution exactly

**Implication:** Management provides institutional-grade disclosure exceeding minimum TSX requirements. Detailed dilution reconciliation allows investors to assess equity compensation philosophy, conversion risks, and capital structure clarity. Contrast with REITs reporting only basic/diluted totals.

**Governance Score:** Enhanced (vs. Standard) - supports higher confidence in financial reporting quality and management transparency.

**Credit Impact:** Positive - enhanced disclosure reduces information risk and supports credit analysis confidence.

## Appendix A: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```
