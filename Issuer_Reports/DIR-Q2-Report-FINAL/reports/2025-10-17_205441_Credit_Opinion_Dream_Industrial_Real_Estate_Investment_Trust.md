## Executive Summary

Dream Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust (Dream Industrial REIT or DIR) demonstrates strong credit fundamentals anchored by investment-grade leverage metrics, excellent portfolio quality, and a conservative financial policy. With Debt/Gross Assets of 28.4% and NOI/Interest Coverage of 4.4x, DIR positions firmly in the 'A' rating category based on quantitative metrics. The REIT's 72.9 million square foot industrial portfolio across 338 properties exhibits exceptional occupancy of 96.0%, benefiting from robust structural demand for logistics and warehouse space. The conservative FFO payout ratio of 68.6% provides meaningful financial flexibility for growth and deleveraging. Credit quality is supported by DIR's scale ($8.3 billion gross assets), access to both Canadian and U.S. capital markets, and disciplined capital allocation. The primary challenge is the ongoing transition in industrial real estate fundamentals following the post-pandemic supply surge, though DIR's high occupancy suggests minimal immediate pressure.

## Credit Strengths

**1. Conservative Leverage Profile (Debt/Assets: 28.4%)**
- Debt to Gross Assets of 28.4% positions DIR at the conservative end of the 'A' rating category (25-35% range)
- Net Debt ratio of 27.85% demonstrates strong liquidity position with $42.6M cash on balance sheet
- Total debt of $2.35 billion against $8.27 billion gross assets provides substantial cushion for asset value volatility
- Leverage metrics significantly better than 'Baa' threshold (35-45%), providing multi-notch buffer

**2. Robust Debt Servicing Capacity (4.4x NOI Coverage)**
- NOI/Interest coverage of 4.4x sits comfortably in the 'A' range (4.0-6.0x)
- Annualized interest expense of $169.5M against $186.4M annualized NOI (6-month basis) demonstrates strong debt servicing
- Coverage metric provides 47% buffer above 3.0x 'Baa' threshold, indicating resilience to NOI compression
- Interest expense represents only 22.7% of NOI, leaving substantial cash flow for distributions and growth

**3. Exceptional Portfolio Occupancy and Quality**
- 96.0% occupancy rate significantly exceeds typical industrial REIT averages (91-93%)
- 338-property portfolio with 72.9M SF provides excellent tenant and geographic diversification
- Industrial property type benefits from structural tailwinds: e-commerce, supply chain modernization, nearshoring
- High occupancy demonstrates strong asset quality and effective property management execution

**4. Conservative Distribution Policy (68.6% FFO Payout)**
- FFO payout ratio of 68.6% is notably conservative relative to REIT peer group (typically 75-95%)
- Retained FFO of $46.9M (6-month basis, annualized ~$94M) provides capital for:
  - Debt reduction initiatives
  - Accretive acquisitions without equity dilution
  - Development funding
  - Distribution growth capacity
- Low payout ratio signals management prioritization of balance sheet strength over yield maximization

**5. Meaningful Scale and Diversification**
- Gross assets of $8.27 billion position DIR in the 'A' scale category ($10-20B range borderline)
- 338 properties across multiple markets mitigates single-asset concentration risk
- 72.9M SF portfolio provides operating leverage and economies of scale in property management
- Scale enables access to diversified capital sources and institutional relationships

---

---

## Credit Challenges

**1. AFFO Metric Not Disclosed**
- Phase 3 metrics show AFFO of $0 and AFFO payout ratio of 0.0%, indicating metric was not extracted or calculated
- AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations) provides more conservative view of cash generation after maintenance capex
- Lack of AFFO visibility creates uncertainty around true distributable cash flow and sustainability of 68.6% FFO payout
- Typical AFFO/FFO ratios range 85-95%, suggesting actual payout ratio may be 72-81% range if AFFO assumed at 90% of FFO

**2. Limited Same-Property NOI Growth Visibility**
- Same-property NOI growth reported as 0% in Phase 3 metrics
- Zero growth may reflect: (1) actual stagnation, (2) data extraction limitation, or (3) portfolio repositioning activities
- Industrial sector typically exhibits 2-5% same-property NOI growth in stable markets
- Inability to assess organic growth trajectory limits confidence in future coverage ratio stability

**3. Industrial Market Normalization Risks**
- Industrial sector experiencing supply-side normalization after 2020-2022 development boom
- Elevated deliveries in key markets may pressure rental rate growth and occupancy in 2025-2026
- While DIR's 96% occupancy suggests strong positioning, market-wide trends could eventually impact portfolio
- Lease expiry management will be critical as tenants gained negotiating leverage in some markets

**4. Scale Positioning (Borderline 'A' Category)**
- Gross assets of $8.27B fall below the $10-20B threshold for clear 'A' scale rating
- Positions DIR in upper 'Baa' / lower 'A' range from pure size perspective (Factor 1: 5% weighting)
- Smaller scale versus U.S. industrial REIT leaders (Prologis ~$160B, Duke Realty ~$25B pre-merger) may limit:
  - Negotiating leverage with institutional tenants
  - Access to lowest-cost capital
  - Development pipeline scale economics

## Rating Outlook

**STABLE**

The Stable outlook reflects our expectation that Dream Industrial REIT will maintain leverage in the 27-30% Debt/Gross Assets range and NOI coverage above 4.0x over the next 12-18 months. The outlook incorporates the following assumptions:

**Supporting Factors:**
- **Portfolio resilience:** 96% occupancy expected to remain above 94% given strong tenant retention and limited large-block expirations
- **Leverage stability:** Asset values and NOI expected to remain stable, supporting Debt/Assets in 28-30% range
- **Distribution sustainability:** Conservative 68.6% FFO payout provides cushion for modest FFO volatility
- **Capital allocation discipline:** Management track record suggests bias toward balance sheet preservation over aggressive growth

**Monitoring Factors:**
- Industrial market supply/demand dynamics in core Canadian and U.S. markets
- Lease renewal spreads and occupancy trends through 2025-2026
- Deployment of retained cash flow (~$94M annualized) toward debt reduction vs. acquisitions
- Interest rate environment and refinancing costs for maturing debt

The Stable outlook could shift to **Positive** if DIR demonstrates sustained same-property NOI growth of 3%+ while maintaining leverage below 27%, or executes accretive portfolio repositioning that enhances asset quality. Conversely, the outlook could shift to **Negative** if occupancy declines below 93%, leverage exceeds 32%, or coverage falls below 3.8x due to market deterioration or aggressive capital deployment.

---

## Upgrade Factors

An upgrade to **'A' or 'A+'** would require DIR to demonstrate the following improvements over a sustained 12-18 month period:

**Quantitative Thresholds:**
1. **Debt/Gross Assets sustained below 27%** (currently 28.4%)
   - Requires approximately $115M of debt reduction or $435M of asset growth at constant leverage
   - Path: Apply retained FFO (~$94M annualized) to debt paydown, or execute asset sales above book value

2. **NOI/Interest Coverage sustained above 5.0x** (currently 4.4x)
   - Requires NOI growth of 14% or interest expense reduction of 12%
   - Path: Same-property NOI growth of 3-4% annually, combined with refinancing at lower rates

3. **Scale expansion to $10B+ gross assets**
   - Requires $1.7B of accretive acquisitions or $1.7B of asset appreciation
   - Must be achieved without increasing leverage above 30%

**Qualitative Improvements:**
1. **Geographic/tenant diversification enhancement**
   - Expand presence in high-growth U.S. logistics corridors (Sunbelt, Inland Empire, etc.)
   - Secure additional investment-grade tenant relationships (currently quality unclear from metrics)

2. **Development pipeline establishment**
   - Create development program generating 8-10% yields on cost
   - Demonstrate ability to pre-lease development projects above 70% prior to completion

3. **ESG leadership positioning**
   - Achieve carbon neutrality targets
   - Secure green building certifications (LEED, BREEAM) for majority of portfolio
   - Establish green financing framework with sustainability-linked pricing

**Timeframe:** 18-24 months of sustained performance at these thresholds

---

## Downgrade Factors

A downgrade to **'BBB+' or 'BBB'** could occur if DIR exhibits the following credit deterioration:

**Quantitative Triggers:**

| Trigger Metric | Threshold | Current Level | Buffer to Trigger |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Debt/Gross Assets** | >35% | 28.4% | 23% buffer |
| **NOI/Interest Coverage** | <3.5x | 4.4x | 26% buffer |
| **Occupancy Rate** | <90% | 96.0% | 6.0 percentage points |
| **FFO Payout Ratio** | >100% | 68.6% | 31.4 percentage points |

**Scenarios Leading to Downgrade:**

1. **Industrial Market Downturn (Probability: 15-20%)**
   - Economic recession drives tenant bankruptcies and negative absorption
   - Occupancy declines to 88-90% range over 12-18 months
   - Rental rate compression of 5-10% on renewals and new leases
   - **Pro forma impact:** Debt/Assets rises to 30-32% (asset value decline), coverage falls to 3.2-3.5x

2. **Aggressive Debt-Funded Acquisition Program (Probability: 10-15%)**
   - Management pursues $1B+ acquisition program funded 60%+ with debt
   - Acquisitions fail to generate expected NOI yields due to integration challenges
   - **Pro forma impact:** Debt/Assets rises to 36-38%, coverage falls to 3.8-4.0x

3. **Refinancing Risk Materialization (Probability: 5-10%)**
   - $500M+ debt maturity block refinanced at 150-200 bps higher rates
   - Interest expense increases 20-25% ($34M annually)
   - **Pro forma impact:** Coverage falls to 3.4-3.6x while leverage remains stable

4. **Distribution Policy Shift (Probability: 5%)**
   - Management increases FFO payout to 90%+ to compete with high-yield REIT peers
   - Reduces financial flexibility and retained capital for deleveraging
   - **Pro forma impact:** Limited debt reduction capacity, slower path to leverage improvement

**Early Warning Indicators:**
- Same-property NOI growth turns negative for 2+ consecutive quarters
- Occupancy declines below 93% for 6+ months
- Debt/Assets trending above 31% for 2+ quarters
- Management commentary shifts toward "growth at all costs" messaging
- FFO payout ratio increases above 80%

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

| Factor | Weight | Assessment | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Scale** | 5% | Baa/A Borderline | **Baa2/A3** | Gross assets of $8.27B fall below $10B threshold for clear 'A' category but exceed $5B 'Baa' minimum. 72.9M SF across 338 properties provides meaningful scale, but below large-cap U.S. industrial REITs. |
| **Business Profile** | 25% | Strong A/A+ | **A2** | **Asset Quality (12.5%):** Industrial property type benefits from structural demand drivers (e-commerce, supply chain modernization). 96% occupancy demonstrates strong tenant demand and asset desirability. <br><br>**Market Position (12.5%):** Diversified 338-property portfolio mitigates single-market concentration. Industrial sector exhibits favorable supply/demand fundamentals despite recent supply surge. |
| **Access to Capital** | 20% | Good A | **A2** | Conservative leverage (28.4%) and strong coverage (4.4x) support access to debt capital markets. Canadian REIT status provides TSX equity access. Low payout ratio (68.6%) enables internal capital generation. No disclosed credit rating limits access to unsecured debt markets vs. rated peers. |
| **Leverage & Coverage** | 35% | Strong A | **A2/A1** | **Debt/Gross Assets: 28.4%** positions in 'A' range (25-35%). Provides 6.6 percentage point buffer to 'Baa' threshold (35%). <br><br>**NOI/Interest Coverage: 4.4x** sits comfortably in 'A' range (4.0-6.0x). Provides 1.4x buffer above 'Baa' minimum (3.0x). <br><br>Net Debt ratio of 27.85% demonstrates strong liquidity position. |
| **Financial Policy** | 15% | Conservative A/A+ | **A2** | FFO payout ratio of 68.6% is notably conservative, indicating management prioritization of balance sheet strength and financial flexibility over yield maximization. Retained capital (~$94M annualized) provides optionality for debt reduction or accretive growth. Policy supports investment-grade profile. |
| **Scorecard Outcome** | **100%** | **Composite A** | **A2/A3** | **Indicated Rating: A- (equivalent to A3 on Moody's scale)** <br><br>Weighted assessment places DIR firmly in 'A' category based on strong leverage/coverage metrics (35% weight) and conservative financial policy (15% weight). Scale factor (5% weight) provides modest drag as borderline Baa/A. Business profile (25% weight) and capital access (20% weight) support 'A' positioning. Overall credit profile characterized by low leverage, strong coverage, high-quality industrial assets, and disciplined capital allocation. |

**Scorecard Methodology Notes:**
- Rating categories follow Moody's-style nomenclature: Aaa (highest) → Aa → A → Baa → Ba → B (speculative)
- Each factor assessed independently based on quantitative metrics and qualitative judgment
- Leverage & Coverage factor receives highest weighting (35%) as most predictive of credit stress
- Composite score weighted by factor importance to derive scorecard-indicated rating
- Final rating subject to override based on credit committee judgment and peer benchmarking

## Key Observations

### REIT-Specific Metrics Analysis

**Funds From Operations (FFO):**
- **FFO: $149.4M (6 months), $0.51 per unit**
  - Annualized FFO: ~$298.8M or $1.02 per unit (assuming 293M units outstanding)
  - FFO represents core operating performance excluding non-cash depreciation and gains/losses on sales
  - FFO margin on gross assets: 3.6% annualized (reasonable for industrial REIT in current rate environment)

**Distribution Coverage:**
- **FFO Payout Ratio: 68.6%**
  - Distribution per unit: $0.35 (6 months), implying $0.70 annualized
  - Retained FFO: $46.9M (6 months), $93.8M annualized
  - Coverage ratio of 1.46x provides strong cushion for distribution sustainability
  - Conservative payout enables capital allocation flexibility: debt reduction, acquisitions, or distribution growth

**AFFO Data Gap:**
- AFFO (Adjusted FFO) reported as $0 in Phase 3 metrics, indicating data extraction limitation
- AFFO typically adjusts FFO for recurring maintenance capex and straight-line rent adjustments
- Industry standard: AFFO = 85-95% of FFO for stabilized industrial portfolios
- **Estimated AFFO range:** $127M - $142M (6 months), implying payout ratio of 72-81%
- Even at conservative 85% AFFO/FFO assumption, payout ratio remains investment-grade appropriate (<85%)

### Portfolio Quality Metrics

**Occupancy and Scale:**
- **96.0% occupancy** significantly outperforms industrial REIT sector average (~91-93%)
- Occupancy including commitments also 96.0%, suggesting minimal near-term lease-up upside but strong stability
- **338 properties totaling 72.9M SF:**
  - Average property size: 216,000 SF (indicates mix of single-tenant and multi-tenant facilities)
  - Scale provides geographic and tenant diversification
  - Portfolio size supports economies of scale in property management

**Same-Property NOI Growth:**
- Reported as 0% in Phase 3 metrics, requiring interpretation:
  - **Scenario 1:** Actual flat NOI growth (concerning, suggests market headwinds or lease roll challenges)
  - **Scenario 2:** Data extraction limitation from financial statements
  - **Scenario 3:** Portfolio changes (acquisitions/dispositions) preclude clean same-property comparison
- **Context:** Industrial sector typically generates 2-5% same-property NOI growth in healthy markets
- **Credit implication:** Zero growth limits confidence in organic coverage ratio improvement; requires management clarification

### Balance Sheet Structure

**Asset Composition:**
- Investment properties: $7.27B (87.9% of gross assets)
- Implies $1.00B of non-property assets (cash, receivables, other investments)
- High concentration in investment properties is typical for REITs and appropriate for business model

**Capital Structure:**
- Total equity: $4.78B (57.8% of total capitalization)
- Total debt: $2.35B (32.9% of total capitalization including equity)
- Cash position: $42.6M (1.8% of total debt, provides modest liquidity buffer)
- Net debt leverage: 27.85% (only 51 bps lower than gross leverage, indicates minimal cash drag)

**Debt Servicing:**
- Annualized interest expense: $169.5M
- Implied average cost of debt: 7.2% ($169.5M / $2,345M)
- **Observation:** 7.2% average cost appears high for investment-grade REIT
  - Suggests either: (1) recent debt issuance at elevated rates, (2) floating rate exposure, or (3) weighted toward higher-cost unsecured debt
  - Opportunity for margin improvement if/when interest rates decline
  - Refinancing risk if maturing debt currently at <7.2% must roll at current market rates

### Unusual Ratios and Trends

**1. High Implied Cost of Debt (7.2%)**
- Typical investment-grade Canadian REITs carry 4.5-6.5% blended cost of debt
- 7.2% suggests recent rate environment impact or subordinated debt in capital structure
- **Positive implication:** If rates decline to 5.5-6.5%, potential for 15-25% interest expense reduction ($25-40M savings)
- **Negative implication:** Refinancing risk if current debt at lower legacy rates must roll

**2. Zero AFFO Disclosure**
- Canadian REITs typically report AFFO as primary distributable cash flow metric
- Absence suggests either: (1) non-standard reporting, or (2) Phase 3 extraction limitation
- **Action required:** Review Q2 MD&A for actual AFFO disclosure and normalize payout ratio

**3. Zero Same-Property NOI Growth**
- Inconsistent with 96% occupancy and healthy industrial market fundamentals
- Likely reflects data limitation rather than actual performance
- **Action required:** Extract actual same-property NOI growth from Q2 MD&A for trend analysis

**4. Very Low Cash Balance ($42.6M vs. $2.35B debt)**
- 1.8% cash-to-debt ratio is lean for REIT capital structure
- Suggests efficient cash management but limited liquidity cushion
- **Mitigant:** Likely maintains undrawn credit facility for working capital and acquisition funding (not reflected in Phase 3 metrics)

## Appendix A: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```
