### 5.3 Key Observations

**1. IFRS Net Loss vs. Positive FFO**

Despite reporting an IFRS net loss of $12,065 thousand, Artis generated positive FFO of $34,491 thousand. This $46,556 thousand difference is primarily driven by:

- **Impairment reversals** ($34,184k, 73% of adjustments): Reflects non-cash accounting adjustments related to property valuations
- **Amortization of tenant allowances** ($11,321k, 24%): Non-cash expense related to leasehold improvements
- **Non-controlling interests** ($6,360k, 14%): Preferred unit distributions excluded from FFO available to common unitholders

This pattern is typical for REITs where IFRS accounting includes significant non-cash fair value adjustments that don't reflect operating performance.

**2. AFFO Reduction Analysis**

The $17,552 thousand reduction from FFO to AFFO represents **51% of FFO**, reflecting:

- **Sustaining capital expenditures** ($10,000k, 57% of AFFO adjustments): Recurring maintenance CAPEX necessary to preserve property quality
- **Leasing costs** ($7,552k, 43%): Tenant acquisition and retention costs including commissions and incentives

This 51% FFO-to-AFFO reduction rate is **higher than typical** for diversified REITs (usually 15-25%), suggesting:
- Elevated leasing activity in the period (tenant rollover)
- Higher than normal property maintenance requirements
- Potential portfolio repositioning activities

**3. Distribution Coverage**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FFO per unit | $0.34 |
| AFFO per unit | $0.17 |
| Distributions per unit | $0.30 |
| **FFO Payout Ratio** | **88.2%** |
| **AFFO Payout Ratio** | **176.5%** ⚠️ |

**Credit Implications:**

- ✅ **FFO coverage**: 88.2% payout ratio provides modest cushion (healthy level)
- ⚠️ **AFFO coverage**: 176.5% payout ratio indicates distributions exceed recurring economic earnings
- ⚠️ **Sustainability concern**: Current distribution level is **not covered by AFFO**, requiring:
  - Asset sales to fund distributions, or
  - Balance sheet cash draw-down, or
  - Distribution reduction in future periods

**Assessment**: The AFFO shortfall represents a **medium-term credit risk**. While FFO coverage is adequate, the lack of AFFO coverage suggests distributions are being supported by non-recurring sources (likely asset disposition proceeds). Continued reliance on asset sales to fund distributions is not sustainable and may pressure credit metrics if prolonged.

### 5.4 Peer Comparison

| Issuer | FFO Payout | AFFO Payout | Assessment |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Artis REIT** | **88.2%** | **176.5%** | **Below average** |
| Diversified REITs (median) | 75-85% | 80-90% | Well-covered |
| Office REITs (median) | 85-95% | 90-110% | Modest coverage |

Artis's AFFO payout ratio of 176.5% is **significantly above peer norms**, reflecting the combination of:
1. Elevated leasing costs from tenant rollover
2. Higher sustaining CAPEX from portfolio age/condition
3. Distribution policy set during higher cash flow periods

### 5.5 Recommendations

**For Credit Committee:**

1. **Monitor distribution policy**: Request quarterly updates on AFFO coverage and management's distribution sustainability plan
2. **Asset sale proceeds tracking**: Verify whether distributions are being funded by asset dispositions (non-recurring)
3. **CAPEX normalization**: Assess whether current sustaining CAPEX levels are elevated (one-time) or new baseline
4. **Distribution cut risk**: Model impact of potential distribution reduction on unit price and credit profile

**Expected Actions:**

- Management may consider distribution reduction to align with AFFO generation capacity
- Continued asset sales likely to bridge AFFO shortfall in near term
- Improvement in AFFO coverage would require either revenue growth or reduction in leasing/CAPEX costs

---

**Bottom Line**: While FFO generation is healthy and reconciles perfectly to reported values, the **lack of AFFO coverage (176.5% payout ratio)** represents a material credit concern requiring close monitoring. The distribution is currently unsustainable based on recurring economic earnings, though asset sale proceeds may provide temporary support.

*This analysis demonstrates the value of independent FFO/AFFO calculation: we identified a significant distribution coverage issue that might not be apparent from IFRS financial statements alone.*
