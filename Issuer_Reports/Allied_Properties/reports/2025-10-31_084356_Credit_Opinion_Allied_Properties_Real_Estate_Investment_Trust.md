## Ratings Summary

| Rating Category | Rating | Outlook |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Issuer Rating** | Not available | Stable |
| **Source** | Analysis-derived | As of 2025-09-30 |

**Note:** This is a credit analysis report, not an official credit rating assignment.

## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

Allied Properties REIT faces **elevated credit risk** driven by unsustainable distribution coverage, high leverage, and significant market stress. The AFFO payout ratio of 166.7% indicates distributions exceed cash generation, while the distribution cut prediction model assigns a 59.9% probability of a near-term cut (HIGH risk). Combined with 83.6% debt-to-assets leverage and a depressed unit price ($15.26), Allied's credit profile warrants **cautious monitoring**.

**Key Credit Concerns:**
- AFFO payout ratio 166.7% - distributions not covered by cash flow
- Distribution cut probability 59.9% (HIGH risk per ML model)
- Debt/Assets ratio 83.6% - well above sector norms
- One historical distribution cut with minimal recovery (<75%)
- Unit price down significantly, market cap $2.9B vs enterprise value $7.5B

**Strengths:**
- Strong NOI generation ($241.9M for 9 months)
- Diversified urban office portfolio across major Canadian cities
- 99.98% fixed-rate debt reduces interest rate risk
- Positive operating cash flow ($140M)
- NOI/Interest coverage 2.44x (adequate but declining)

## Macroeconomic Environment

### Interest Rate Context

**Canada:**
- **Bank of Canada Policy Rate:** 2.75%
- **12-Month Change:** -125 bps
- **Rate Cycle:** EASING
- **Peak Rate (12-Month):** 5.25%
- **Credit Environment:** ACCOMMODATIVE
- **Credit Stress Score:** 22/100

**United States:**
- **Federal Funds Rate:** 4.22%
- **12-Month Change:** -91 bps
- **Rate Cycle:** MILD EASING

**Cross-Border Dynamics:**
- **Canada vs US Rate Spread:** -147 bps
- **Spread Trend:** N/A

### Rate Environment Assessment

Bank of Canada in easing cycle (2.75%, down 125 bps from 5.25% peak). Accommodative credit environment (stress score: 22/100) supports REIT refinancing and capital markets access. US Fed also in mild easing mode (4.22%, down 91 bps), creating synchronized North American rate movement. Canada maintains typical 147 bps discount to US rates.

### Credit Implications

POSITIVE for REITs: Lower rates reduce borrowing costs and improve debt service coverage ratios. Easing environment supports property valuations and equity issuance capacity. REITs with near-term debt maturities benefit from refinancing at lower rates. Credit spreads typically tighten in accommodative conditions, improving access to capital markets. Watch for rate stabilization signals as cycle matures; plan refinancing during easing window.

### 2. FFO, AFFO, ACFO, and AFCF Analysis

#### 2.1 Overview

This section analyzes the issuer's recurring economic earnings (FFO/AFFO), sustainable cash flow (ACFO), and adjusted free cash flow (AFCF) metrics, providing comprehensive earnings-based and cash flow-based perspectives on distribution sustainability and capital markets reliance.

**Metric Definitions:**
- **FFO (Funds From Operations)**: Earnings metric starting from IFRS Net Income, adjusted for non-cash items per REALPAC (January 2022)
- **AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations)**: FFO adjusted for sustaining capital requirements (earnings-based recurring income)
- **ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations)**: Cash flow metric starting from IFRS CFO, adjusted per REALPAC (January 2023)
- **AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow)**: ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities (most conservative free cash flow measure)

#### 2.2 FFO/AFFO/ACFO/AFCF Summary: Reported vs. Calculated

- AFFO: STRONG

*Source: Calculated per REALPAC White Paper on FFO & AFFO for IFRS (January 2022)*

**Key Observations:**
FFO variance: 18.5%. AFFO variance: 94.3%.

**FFO Validation:**
FFO variance (18.5%) exceeds 5% threshold. Review methodology differences. AFFO variance (94.3%) exceeds 5% threshold. Likely differences in CAPEX/leasing cost treatment.

**AFFO Validation:**
⚠️ **AFFO Variance:** Calculated differs from reported by 106,487 (94.3%)
  - This variance exceeds the 5% threshold and requires investigation

**Validation Notes:**
- AFFO variance (94.3%) exceeds 5% threshold. Likely differences in CAPEX/leasing cost treatment.

**REALPAC Adjustments:** 5 of 5 adjustments populated

**Data Quality:** Strong
**Calculation Method:** Unknown

**Methodology Notes:**
- Reported values: As disclosed in issuer's MD&A FFO/AFFO reconciliation tables
- Calculated values: Per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022) - 26 standardized adjustments (A-Z)
- Variance analysis: Differences may arise from non-REALPAC adjustments or classification differences

#### 2.4 ACFO Reconciliation

This reconciliation demonstrates the adjustment process from IFRS Cash Flow from Operations to ACFO per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023). This section presents both issuer-reported values (if disclosed - rare) and our calculated values using standardized REALPAC guidelines.

**2.4.1 Issuer-Reported ACFO Reconciliation**

*As disclosed in issuer's MD&A (if available - most issuers do not report ACFO)*

## Issuer-Reported ACFO Reconciliation

**Not disclosed** - Issuer does not report ACFO.

*Note: Most issuers (> 95%) do not report ACFO per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023). This is expected. All ACFO metrics calculated using REALPAC methodology (see Section 2.4.2).*

**2.4.2 REALPAC-Calculated ACFO Reconciliation**

*Calculated using standardized REALPAC methodology for cross-issuer comparability*

Insufficient data - ACFO reconciliation not available. Requires cash flow statement data in Phase 2 extraction.

**Key Observations:**
ACFO not calculated. Requires cash_flow_from_operations in Phase 2 extraction.

**ACFO Validation:**
ACFO validation not available

**Consistency Checks:**

#### 2.8 Dilution Analysis

**Status:** Yes

This section analyzes equity dilution from convertible securities, options, and warrants, assessing materiality and impact on per-unit metrics and credit quality.

🚨 HIGH dilution - material equity overhang, review impact on debt capacity and unit holder value dilution

| Dilution Metric | Value | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Basic Units Outstanding | 127,955,983 | - |
| Diluted Units Outstanding | 139,765,128 | - |
| Dilution Percentage | 9.23% | HIGH |
| Material Instruments | stock_options, other | - |
| Convertible Debt Risk | NONE | - |
| Governance Score | Enhanced | Enhanced disclosure = better transparency |

**Credit Assessment:** 🚨 HIGH dilution - material equity overhang, review impact on debt capacity and unit holder value dilution

**Key Considerations:**
- Dilution < 3%: Low impact on per-unit metrics
- Dilution 3-7%: Moderate equity overhang - monitor
- Dilution > 7%: Material dilution - affects debt capacity
- Convertible debt > 5%: Review conversion terms and forced conversion scenarios

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** No

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the forward-looking speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves based on current run rate. This is a **liquidity stress test** assuming NO future access to capital markets. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions).

**Formula:**
```
Mandatory Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (period amounts)
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period
```

**Note:** New financing is NOT subtracted - burn rate assumes no future capital raises.

**Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Reporting Period | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **AFCF (Period)** | Not available | Q3 2025 (9 months ended September 30, 2025) | Free cash flow |
| **Mandatory Obligations:** | | | |
| - Total Debt Service | Not available | Q3 2025 (9 months ended September 30, 2025) | Interest + Principal |
| - Total Distributions | Not available | Q3 2025 (9 months ended September 30, 2025) | Common + Preferred |
| **Total Obligations** | N/A | Q3 2025 (9 months ended September 30, 2025) | - |
| **Period Deficit/(Surplus)** | N/A | Q3 2025 (9 months ended September 30, 2025) | AFCF - Obligations |
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | N/A | Per month | N/A-month period |

**Self-Funding Analysis:**
- **Self-Funding Ratio:** Not availablex (AFCF / Mandatory Obligations)
- **Interpretation:** Not calculated without AFCF
- **Capital Markets Reliance:** Unable to assess without AFCF self-funding ratio

**Liquidity Position:**

| Liquidity Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Cash and Cash Equivalents** | Not available | End of period |
| **Marketable Securities** | 0 | Liquid investments |
| **Less: Restricted Cash** | (0) | Not available for operations |
| **Available Cash** | Not available | Immediately available |
| **Undrawn Credit Facilities** | Not available | Remaining capacity |
| **Total Available Liquidity** | Not available | Cash + facilities |

**Cash Runway Analysis:**

| Scenario | Liquidity Base | Runway (Months) | Runway (Years) | Depletion Date | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash Only** | Not available | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Extended** (w/ facilities) | Not available | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Runway Calculation:**
- **Cash Only:** Available Cash (Not available) ÷ Monthly Burn (N/A) = N/A months
- **Extended:** Total Liquidity (Not available) ÷ Monthly Burn (N/A) = N/A months

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Risk Level | Risk Score | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | N/A | N/A/4 | Not available |

**Risk Thresholds:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (Score 4): < 6 months runway - Immediate financing required
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (Score 3): 6-12 months runway - Near-term capital raise needed
- ⚠️ **MODERATE** (Score 2): 12-24 months runway - Plan financing within 12 months
- ✓ **LOW** (Score 1): > 24 months runway - Adequate liquidity runway

**Warning Flags:**
Monitor liquidity position

**Recommendations:**
Monitor liquidity position quarterly

**Sustainable Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Target Runway** | 24 months | Management target |
| **Sustainable Monthly Burn** | N/A | Maximum sustainable burn rate |
| **Actual Monthly Burn** | N/A | Current burn rate |
| **Excess/(Deficit) Burn** | N/A | Not calculated |

**Burn Rate Interpretation:**
AFCF sufficient to cover all mandatory obligations - no burn rate

**Credit Implications:**
Not assessed without AFCF data

#### 4.4 Liquidity and Distribution Coverage Assessment (Detailed Analysis)

*This section expands on the summary coverage metrics presented in Section 2.5 (Distribution Coverage Ratios) and Section 2.7 (AFCF Analysis) with detailed calculation methodology, per-unit analysis, and credit implications.*

Based on available metrics, the issuer demonstrates moderate liquidity with 2.44x interest coverage. Detailed liquidity analysis requires review of debt maturity schedule and available credit facilities.

*Current Distribution:*
- **Monthly distribution per unit:** 0.1216 CAD
- **Annual distribution per unit:** 1.4592 CAD
- **Current yield:** N/A%

*Distribution Cut History:*
- **Total cuts detected (10-year history):** 1
- **Most recent cut date:** 2024-01
- **Most recent cut magnitude:** 52.4%
- **Recovery status:** Minimal restoration (<75%)
- **Current distribution vs pre-cut level:** 38.6%

*Recovery Analysis:*

Recovery analysis unavailable

**Credit Implications:**
- **Distribution stability:** History of 1 cut(s) indicates Cut history requires monitoring
- **Management credibility:** Distribution cut history indicates financial stress
- **Sustainability outlook:** Monitor closely

**Detailed Coverage Analysis:**

*Per-Unit Basis - Distribution Coverage Calculation:*

The per-unit coverage analysis shows how many times distributions are covered by operating and free cash flow on a per-unit basis:

- **ACFO per unit:** Not available / **Distributions per unit:** 1.3500 = **Not available coverage**
  - Interpretation: Every dollar of distributions is covered Not available times by sustainable operating cash flow
  - Credit Implication: Not available

- **AFCF per unit:** Not available / **Distributions per unit:** 1.3500 = **Not availablex coverage**
  - Interpretation: Every dollar of distributions is covered Not available times by free cash flow after all investments
  - Credit Implication: Not available

*Total-Level Coverage - YTD Metrics vs. Annualized Obligations:*

This analysis measures the REIT's ability to service all financing obligations from available cash flow:

- **Distribution Coverage (YTD):**
  - ACFO: Not available thousands / Total distributions: Not available thousands = **Not available** (Not available)
  - AFCF: Not available thousands / Total distributions: Not available thousands = **Not available** (Not available)

- **Debt Service Coverage (AFCF vs. Annualized):**
  - AFCF YTD: Not available thousands / Annualized debt service: Not available thousands = **Not available**
  - Benchmark: >1.0x = Self-funding debt service from free cash flow
  - Assessment: Coverage of Not available indicates REIT's ability to service debt from operating cash flow

- **Self-Funding Capacity:**
  - Self-funding ratio: **Not available** (AFCF / Total obligations)
  - Financing gap: **Not available** CAD thousands
  - Assessment: Ratio indicates degree of capital markets reliance (>1.0x = self-funding, 0.5-1.0x = moderate reliance, <0.5x = high reliance)

*Residual Cash Flows After Distributions:*

- ACFO residual: **Not available** CAD thousands (operating cash flow remaining after distributions)
- AFCF residual: **Not available** CAD thousands (free cash flow remaining after distributions and investments)

*Interest Coverage:*
- NOI/Interest coverage of 2.44x is at or above typical REIT minimum (2.0x)
- Benchmark: >2.0x = Strong, 1.5-2.0x = Adequate, 1.2-1.5x = Tight, <1.2x = Insufficient

**Credit Impact Summary:**

1. **Distribution Sustainability:** Unsustainable
2. **Financing Flexibility:** Self-funding ratio of Not available indicates degree of capital markets reliance
3. **Growth Capacity:** Residual AFCF of Not available thousands shows internal capital availability for growth investments

*For summary coverage ratios, see Section 2.5. For AFCF calculation methodology, see Section 2.7.*

## Appendix B: Moody's-Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

Not available

---

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

**Total Debt Service:**
```
Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Where:
  Annualized Interest = Interest expense for the reporting period (annualized)
  Principal Repayments = Scheduled principal payments for the reporting period

Note: Period amounts should be consistent (e.g., all quarterly or all annual)
```

**NOI / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
NOI / Debt Service Coverage = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight debt service coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient debt service coverage
```

**EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage = EBITDA / Total Debt Service

Where:
  EBITDA = NOI (for REITs, NOI approximates EBITDA)
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Note: For REITs, NOI/Debt Service and EBITDA/Debt Service are equivalent
```

**FFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
FFO / Debt Service Coverage = FFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.5x = Strong coverage
  ≥ 2.0x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Moderate coverage
  < 1.5x = Weak coverage
```

**AFFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFFO / Debt Service Coverage = AFFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong coverage (significant cushion after sustaining capex)
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient coverage
```

**ACFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
ACFO / Debt Service Coverage = ACFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.5x = Strong coverage (cash flow based)
  ≥ 1.25x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (cannot cover debt service from operating cash)
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**
```
FFO = IFRS Net Income
    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```

**AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow):**
```
AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Where:
  ACFO = Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (per REALPAC 2023)
  Net CFI = Cash Flow from Investing Activities (IFRS statement)
            Including: Development CAPEX, acquisitions/dispositions,
                      JV capital contributions/returns

IMPORTANT - Double-Counting Prevention:
  ACFO already deducts:
    - Sustaining CAPEX (Adjustment 4)
    - Sustaining TI (Adjustment 6)
    - External leasing costs (Adjustment 5)

  CFI should ONLY include:
    - Development/growth CAPEX (NOT sustaining)
    - Property acquisitions and dispositions
    - JV capital contributions/returns (NOT distributions)
    - Business combinations
```

**AFCF Per Unit:**
```
AFCF per Unit (Basic) = AFCF / Common Units Outstanding (weighted average)

AFCF per Unit (Diluted) = AFCF / Diluted Units Outstanding (weighted average)

Where:
  Diluted Units = Basic Units + Dilutive Instruments
  Dilutive Instruments = RSUs + DSUs + Options + Convertible Debt + Warrants
```

### AFCF Coverage Metrics

**AFCF Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFCF Debt Service Coverage = AFCF / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (can cover debt service from free cash flow)
  < 1.0x = Reliant on capital markets for debt service
```

**AFCF Payout Ratio:**
```
AFCF Payout Ratio = (Total Distributions / AFCF) × 100

Assessment Thresholds:
  < 100% = Distributions sustainable from free cash flow
  ≥ 100% = Distributions exceed free cash flow
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Ratio:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Where:
  Total Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (per reporting period)

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no capital markets reliance)
  0.8-1.0x = Low reliance on external financing
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate reliance on capital markets
  < 0.5x = High reliance on capital markets

Note: Does NOT subtract new financing - measures inherent cash generation capacity
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Capacity:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Capacity = AFCF - (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Interpretation:
  Positive = Surplus cash after all financing obligations
  Negative = Deficit requiring external financing
```

### Burn Rate and Cash Runway Metrics

**Burn Rate Applicability:**
```
Burn Rate applies when: AFCF < Total Financing Obligations

Where:
  Total Financing Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions

Note: A REIT can have positive AFCF but still burn cash if free cash flow
      is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations.
```

**Monthly Burn Rate:**
```
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period

Where:
  Mandatory Obligations = Total Debt Service + Total Distributions
  New financing is NOT subtracted (assumes no future capital raises)
```

**Self-Funding Ratio (Burn Rate Context):**
```
Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / Mandatory Obligations

Interpretation:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no burn rate - generates surplus)
  0.8-1.0x = Low burn rate (nearly self-funding)
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate burn rate (moderate capital markets reliance)
  < 0.5x = High burn rate (high capital markets reliance)
```

**Cash Runway:**
```
Available Cash = Cash + Marketable Securities - Restricted Cash

Cash Runway (months) = Available Cash / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Extended Runway = (Available Cash + Undrawn Facilities) / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Where:
  Undrawn Facilities = Remaining credit facility capacity
  |Monthly Burn Rate| = Absolute value of monthly burn rate
```

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**
```
Risk Level based on Cash Runway:
  < 6 months    = CRITICAL (Score 4) - Immediate financing required
  6-12 months   = HIGH (Score 3) - Near-term capital raise needed
  12-24 months  = MODERATE (Score 2) - Plan financing within 12 months
  > 24 months   = LOW (Score 1) - Adequate liquidity runway
```

**Sustainable Burn Rate:**
```
Target Runway = 24 months (default)
Sustainable Monthly Burn = Available Cash / Target Runway

Excess Burn = Actual Monthly Burn - Sustainable Monthly Burn

Status:
  Excess Burn < 0 = Below sustainable (cash cushion)
  Excess Burn > 0 = Above sustainable (corrective action needed)
```

### Coverage Quality Assessment

**Distribution Coverage Assessment:**
```
Coverage Quality (applies to FFO/AFFO/ACFO/AFCF coverage):

  ≥ 1.3x = Strong coverage (30%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.1x = Adequate coverage (10%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage (< 10% cushion)
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (distributions exceed metric)
```

**Payout Ratio Assessment:**
```
Payout Ratio Quality (inverse of coverage):

  ≤ 77% = Strong (< 77% payout = 1.3x+ coverage)
  ≤ 91% = Adequate (< 91% payout = 1.1x+ coverage)
  < 100% = Tight (< 100% payout = 1.0x+ coverage)
  ≥ 100% = Insufficient (payout exceeds metric)
```
