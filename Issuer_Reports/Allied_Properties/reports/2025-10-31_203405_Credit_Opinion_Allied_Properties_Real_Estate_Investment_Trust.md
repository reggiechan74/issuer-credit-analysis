## Executive Summary

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating:** Ba2 / Ba3 (analysis-derived)

Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust faces severe financial stress as of Q3 2025, with credit metrics indicating a **Ba3/B1** rating positioning in the non-investment grade category. The REIT's credit profile is characterized by unsustainable distribution coverage, elevated leverage, and significant refinancing risk that collectively point to imminent capital structure adjustment.

The most critical vulnerability is distribution sustainability. With an AFFO payout ratio of 166.7% (issuer-reported), Allied is distributing $1.67 for every dollar of adjusted cash flow generated, a fundamentally unsustainable position. Our distribution cut prediction model assigns a **59.9% probability** of an imminent distribution cut, classifying Allied as "High Risk." This assessment is corroborated by recent distribution history—Allied already cut its distribution by 52.4% in January 2024, and current payout ratios indicate minimal restoration of financial health since that action. The recovery level of only 38.6% from pre-cut levels signals ongoing distress rather than stabilization.

Leverage metrics compound the distribution stress. At 83.6% debt-to-assets and 82.95% net debt ratio, Allied operates with minimal equity cushion. The debt burden is particularly concerning given net debt reaching 12.3x annualized adjusted EBITDA—well above the 10.0x target management has committed to achieving. Interest coverage of 2.44x NOI-to-interest provides limited buffer, especially considering the REIT recorded a $315.8 million IFRS net loss for the nine-month period driven by $394.1 million in unrealized fair value losses on investment properties. These losses reflect market recognition of asset value impairment in the challenged urban office sector.

Market indicators reinforce the credit stress diagnosis. Allied's unit price of $15.26 represents a 31.5% decline from its 52-week peak, with the security exhibiting high volatility (39.9% annualized over 90 days) and negative momentum (-11.8% over three months). Our market risk score of 75/100 ("Very High") indicates capital markets perceive significant distress. The unit price trades at a 60% discount to stated NAV per unit ($38.05), suggesting investors expect further asset writedowns or equity dilution.

However, Allied retains meaningful strengths that prevent a deeper rating assessment. The REIT maintains $803 million in available liquidity ($903 million including accordion features), providing essential runway to execute strategic deleveraging. The portfolio consists of 9.5 million square feet of urban workspace concentrated in Canada's major markets, with 87.4% leased occupancy demonstrating resilient tenant demand despite sectoral headwinds. Management has articulated a clear deleveraging strategy centered on asset monetization, including the pending sale of the 150 West Georgia loan receivable expected to close in H1 2026. The easing macro interest rate environment (Bank of Canada policy rate declining 125 bps to 2.75%) provides tailwinds for refinancing the $2.27 billion in debt maturing 2026-2028.

**Scorecard-Indicated Rating: Ba3/B1** reflecting elevated credit risk with significant downside potential absent successful execution of deleveraging and distribution adjustment strategies. The rating could deteriorate to B2/B3 if management delays necessary capital structure adjustments or fails to execute planned asset sales. Conversely, aggressive deleveraging combined with distribution reset could support Ba2 positioning within 12-18 months.

**Key Credit Drivers:**
1. Scale & Diversification
2. Asset Quality & Portfolio
3. Leverage & Coverage
4. Financial Flexibility

---

## Credit Strengths

- **Scale & Diversification:** Gross assets of $10.4B and 9.5M SF urban workspace portfolio provides meaningful scale, but single-sector (office) and single-country (Canada) concentration limits diversification. Portfolio spans Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver providing geographic breadth within Canada.
- **Leverage & Coverage:** **Critical weakness.** Debt/assets 83.6%, net debt 12.3x EBITDA (target <10x), NOI/interest coverage 2.44x all indicate elevated leverage with minimal cushion. $2.27B debt maturities 2026-2028 create significant refinancing risk. IFRS net loss of $315.8M reflects asset impairment.
- **Financial Flexibility:** **Severely constrained.** AFFO payout ratio 166.7% is unsustainable. Distribution cut probability 59.9% (High Risk) indicates imminent capital structure adjustment. Prior 52.4% distribution cut (Jan 2024) with only 38.6% recovery signals persistent stress. High market volatility (75/100 risk score) limits equity issuance capacity. 9.23% dilution from LP units adds complexity.
- **Liquidity & Cash Flow:** $803M available liquidity ($903M with accordion) provides adequate near-term buffer. However, AFFO of $113M (9mo) insufficient to cover $173M distributions paid, resulting in cash burn. Pending 150 West Georgia loan monetization (H1 2026) critical to liquidity maintenance. Monthly burn rate monitored closely by model.

---

## Credit Challenges

- **Asset Quality & Portfolio:** Urban office portfolio facing structural headwinds reflected in $394M fair value losses. Occupancy 87.4% leased (84.0% occupied) down from 87.2%/85.6% YoY. Average in-place rent $25.19/SF stable but renewal spreads minimal at +1.5%. Portfolio concentrated in Class I urban workspace vulnerable to hybrid work trends.

---

## Rating Outlook

**Outlook: Stable**

**Rationale:**

**Outlook:** Negative (12-18 months)

**Rationale:**

Allied Properties' credit outlook is **Negative**, reflecting our assessment that credit metrics are more likely to deteriorate than improve over the next 12-18 months absent aggressive management intervention. The Negative outlook is driven by three primary factors: (1) the mathematical impossibility of sustaining current distribution levels given 166.7% AFFO payout ratios, (2) execution risk around $2.27 billion in debt refinancing maturing 2026-2028, and (3) ongoing property value deterioration in the urban office sector as reflected in $394 million fair value losses year-to-date.

Our distribution cut prediction model assigns a **59.9% probability** of an imminent distribution cut, the single most important forward-looking indicator of credit stress. The model's top predictive features highlight fundamental cash flow shortfalls: low ACFO (calculated), constrained self-funding ratio, and negative monthly burn rate. These metrics indicate Allied is consuming rather than generating discretionary cash flow, a condition that cannot persist indefinitely without balance sheet repair.

The 12.3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio—significantly above management's stated <10x target—demonstrates limited progress on deleveraging since the January 2024 distribution cut. While management articulates a clear strategy (asset monetization, debt reduction), execution timelines have slipped. The critical 150 West Georgia loan receivable monetization, originally expected by year-end 2025, now targets H1 2026 closing. Similar delays in non-core asset sales extend the period of elevated financial risk.

Market-based indicators reinforce credit stress. Allied's unit price has declined 31.5% from its 52-week peak to $15.26, with high volatility (61.5% annualized over 30 days, 39.9% over 90 days) and negative momentum (-11.8% over 3 months). The market risk score of 75/100 ("Very High") reflects investor perception of significant downside. The 60% discount between market price ($15.26) and stated NAV per unit ($38.05) suggests either substantial future asset writedowns or dilutive equity issuance are anticipated.

The Negative outlook does not imply default risk is imminent. Allied maintains $803 million in available liquidity providing adequate runway through 2026. However, the outlook reflects our view that credit quality is more likely to weaken than strengthen, either through:
1. **Delayed distribution cut:** If management postpones inevitable distribution reduction, cash burn accelerates and refinancing capacity diminishes
2. **Asset sales below book value:** Forced sales at distressed pricing to meet covenant requirements or liquidity needs
3. **Refinancing at elevated spreads:** Credit market repricing of Allied debt given sector stress and credit deterioration

A stabilization of the outlook to Stable would require concrete evidence of: (1) distribution reduction to sustainable 80-90% AFFO payout, (2) successful asset monetization at or near book value, (3) meaningful deleveraging toward <10x net debt/EBITDA, and (4) occupancy and NOI stabilization.

**Base Case Scenario (50% probability):**

Allied announces distribution cut of 25-35% within Q4 2025 or Q1 2026, reducing monthly distribution from $0.1216/unit to $0.08-0.09/unit range. This adjustment brings AFFO payout ratio to sustainable 85-95% range, aligning with sector norms for non-investment grade REITs. Concurrently, Allied executes 150 West Georgia loan monetization in Q1/Q2 2026 generating $250-300 million proceeds (net) applied to debt reduction. Additional non-core asset sales total $200-250 million in 2026, bringing total debt reduction to $450-550 million.

**Pro Forma Metrics (12-month forward):**
- Total Debt: $8.15-8.22B (from $8.67B)
- Debt/Assets: 79-81% (from 83.6%)
- Net Debt/EBITDA: 11.0-11.5x (from 12.3x)
- AFFO Payout Ratio: 85-95% (from 166.7%)
- Liquidity: $650-750M maintained

**Rating Impact:** Rating stabilizes at Ba3, outlook revises to Stable. Distribution cut viewed as necessary credit positive, though unit price experiences initial 10-15% decline on announcement before stabilizing. Successful refinancing of 2026 maturities at credit spreads +200-250 bps over benchmarks.

**Upside Case (25% probability):**

Allied executes aggressive deleveraging program combining larger distribution cut (40-50% reduction to $0.07-0.08/unit monthly), accelerated asset sales ($600-800M total in 2026), and opportunistic equity issuance if unit price recovers. Management prioritizes balance sheet repair over unit price stability. 150 West Georgia monetization exceeds expectations ($300-350M net proceeds). Urban office market stabilizes with return-to-office trends strengthening occupancy and rental rates.

**Pro Forma Metrics (18-month forward):**
- Total Debt: $7.85-8.05B (from $8.67B)
- Debt/Assets: 74-77% (from 83.6%)
- Net Debt/EBITDA: 9.0-9.8x (from 12.3x)
- AFFO Payout Ratio: 75-85% (from 166.7%)
- Occupancy: 88.5-89.5% (from 87.4%)

**Rating Impact:** Upgrade to Ba2 within 18 months. Credit metrics return to investment grade trajectory. Access to unsecured debt markets improves with spreads tightening to +150-200 bps. Unit price recovers to $18-20 range on improved credit fundamentals despite lower distribution.

**Downside Case (20% probability):**

Allied delays distribution cut into Q2 2026 or beyond, prioritizing unit price stability over balance sheet repair. Asset sales execute below expectations ($100-150M only) due to weak urban office transaction market. 150 West Georgia monetization postponed to Q3/Q4 2026 or achieves lower proceeds ($150-200M). Occupancy declines further to 85-86% as major tenants downsize or relocate. Credit facility covenant stress emerges with debt/assets approaching 60% threshold on unencumbered asset base.

**Pro Forma Metrics (12-month forward):**
- Total Debt: $8.55-8.65B (minimal reduction from $8.67B)
- Debt/Assets: 84-86% (increases from 83.6%)
- Net Debt/EBITDA: 13.0-14.0x (increases from 12.3x)
- AFFO Payout Ratio: 140-160% (improves slightly but remains unsustainable)
- Liquidity: $450-600M (declining)

**Rating Impact:** Downgrade to B1/B2 within 12 months. Covenant breach risk emerges. Credit facility amendment or waiver required. Unit price declines to $11-13 range. Forced distribution cut (50-60% reduction) eventually implemented under duress. Market access severely constrained.

**Distressed Case (5% probability):**

Urban office fundamentals deteriorate sharply with major tenant bankruptcies or mass relocations. Occupancy falls below 80%. EBITDA declines 20%+ from current levels. Asset sales market freezes, preventing monetization. Covenant breach triggers immediate liquidity crisis. Credit facility drawn fully. Distribution suspended entirely.

**Pro Forma Metrics (12-18 months):**
- Covenant breach on debt/unencumbered assets or debt service coverage
- Liquidity exhausted except committed accordion facilities
- Distribution suspended (100% cut)
- Forced asset sales at 20-30% discounts to book value
- Equity deeply underwater

**Rating Impact:** Downgrade to Caa1/Caa2 (substantial credit risk, default probable). Restructuring scenario becomes likely involving debt-for-equity exchanges, asset liquidation, or formal insolvency proceedings.

**Key Monitoring Metrics:**

The following metrics should be tracked quarterly to assess credit trajectory:

1. **AFFO Payout Ratio:** Target <95% (currently 166.7%)
2. **Net Debt/EBITDA:** Target <10.5x (currently 12.3x)
3. **Debt/Assets:** Target <80% (currently 83.6%)
4. **Occupancy (Leased/Occupied):** Target >88%/85% (currently 87.4%/84.0%)
5. **Liquidity:** Target >$750M maintained (currently $803M)
6. **Same-Property NOI Growth:** Target >0% (currently +0.2% Q3 YoY)
7. **Distribution Coverage:** Monitor actual cash flow vs. distributions paid quarterly
8. **Asset Sale Pipeline:** Track transaction progress and pricing vs. book value
9. **Refinancing Progress:** Monitor maturity addressing and credit spreads achieved
10. **Unit Price and Market Risk Score:** Track for capital markets access assessment

**Rating Upgrade Factors (18-24 months):**

Allied Properties could achieve an upgrade to Ba2 (or stabilize outlook to Stable from Negative) if the following conditions are met:

1. **Distribution Reset to Sustainable Level:** Cut distribution 25-40% to achieve AFFO payout ratio of 80-90%, demonstrating commitment to balance sheet repair over yield maintenance
2. **Meaningful Deleveraging Execution:** Reduce net debt/EBITDA to <10.5x through combination of asset sales ($500M+), EBITDA growth, and potential equity issuance; achieve debt/assets <80%
3. **Successful Refinancing of Near-Term Maturities:** Refinance 2026-2027 debt maturities ($1.5B+) at acceptable credit spreads (<+250 bps) without material adverse covenant changes
4. **Asset Sale Execution at/Near Book Value:** Complete 150 West Georgia monetization generating $250M+ proceeds; execute non-core sales demonstrating asset values support balance sheet carrying values
5. **Occupancy and Revenue Stabilization:** Maintain leased occupancy >87% and achieve positive same-property NOI growth for 2+ consecutive quarters, indicating operational resilience
6. **Liquidity Maintenance:** Sustain available liquidity >$750M throughout deleveraging period, demonstrating adequate financial runway
7. **Equity Issuance Capacity Restoration:** Unit price recovery toward $20+ and volatility decline enabling accretive equity issuance if needed for balance sheet strengthening

**Specific Threshold Example:** If Allied cuts distribution to $0.08/unit monthly (34% reduction), executes $600M in asset sales over 12-18 months achieving debt/assets of 78% and net debt/EBITDA of 10.2x, maintains occupancy at 87-88%, and successfully refinances 2026 maturities, an upgrade to Ba2 with Stable outlook would be supported.

**Rating Downgrade Factors (6-12 months):**

Allied Properties could face a downgrade to B1/B2 (or accelerated multi-notch downgrade to B2/B3) if the following adverse developments occur:

1. **Distribution Cut Delayed Beyond Q1 2026:** Management postpones inevitable distribution adjustment, accelerating cash burn and weakening refinancing capacity; AFFO payout ratio remains >120% through mid-2026
2. **Asset Sale Execution Failure:** 150 West Georgia monetization postponed beyond Q2 2026 or achieves <$200M proceeds; total asset sales in 2026 <$300M, preventing meaningful deleveraging
3. **Further Asset Value Deterioration:** Fair value losses exceed $500M in 2025, driving debt/assets >85%; NAV per unit declines below $35, widening discount to market price
4. **Occupancy Decline Acceleration:** Leased occupancy falls below 85% with major tenant move-outs or bankruptcies; occupied space drops below 80%
5. **Covenant Breach or Waiver Requirement:** Debt/unencumbered assets approaches 60% covenant threshold requiring bank waiver or amendment; interest coverage falls below 1.75x triggering technical default
6. **Refinancing Failure or Prohibitive Pricing:** Unable to refinance 2026 maturities on acceptable terms; credit spreads exceed +350 bps indicating market loss of confidence; forced to issue secured debt or accept onerous covenant restrictions
7. **Liquidity Crisis Emergence:** Available liquidity falls below $500M without committed refinancing sources; cash burn accelerates beyond asset sale capacity
8. **EBITDA Deterioration:** Annualized adjusted EBITDA declines >10% from current $375M level due to NOI erosion or increased operating costs
9. **Distribution Cut Insufficient:** If distribution cut implemented but sized too small (<20% reduction), failing to restore sustainable coverage and delaying balance sheet repair
10. **Capital Markets Access Lost:** Equity becomes unissuable due to extreme dilution concerns; unsecured debt markets closed to Allied; reliant entirely on secured lending

**Specific Threshold Example:** If Allied maintains current distribution into Q2 2026 (AFFO payout remaining >150%), fails to execute 150 West Georgia sale by mid-2026, experiences occupancy decline to 84%, and faces 2026 refinancing at spreads >+300 bps with covenant restrictions, a downgrade to B1 (or B2 if multiple factors converge) would be warranted.

## Factors That Could Lead to an Upgrade

Allied Properties could achieve an upgrade to Ba2 (or stabilize outlook to Stable from Negative) if the following conditions are met:

1. **Distribution Reset to Sustainable Level:** Cut distribution 25-40% to achieve AFFO payout ratio of 80-90%, demonstrating commitment to balance sheet repair over yield maintenance
2. **Meaningful Deleveraging Execution:** Reduce net debt/EBITDA to <10.5x through combination of asset sales ($500M+), EBITDA growth, and potential equity issuance; achieve debt/assets <80%
3. **Successful Refinancing of Near-Term Maturities:** Refinance 2026-2027 debt maturities ($1.5B+) at acceptable credit spreads (<+250 bps) without material adverse covenant changes
4. **Asset Sale Execution at/Near Book Value:** Complete 150 West Georgia monetization generating $250M+ proceeds; execute non-core sales demonstrating asset values support balance sheet carrying values
5. **Occupancy and Revenue Stabilization:** Maintain leased occupancy >87% and achieve positive same-property NOI growth for 2+ consecutive quarters, indicating operational resilience
6. **Liquidity Maintenance:** Sustain available liquidity >$750M throughout deleveraging period, demonstrating adequate financial runway
7. **Equity Issuance Capacity Restoration:** Unit price recovery toward $20+ and volatility decline enabling accretive equity issuance if needed for balance sheet strengthening

**Specific Threshold Example:** If Allied cuts distribution to $0.08/unit monthly (34% reduction), executes $600M in asset sales over 12-18 months achieving debt/assets of 78% and net debt/EBITDA of 10.2x, maintains occupancy at 87-88%, and successfully refinances 2026 maturities, an upgrade to Ba2 with Stable outlook would be supported.

## Factors That Could Lead to a Downgrade

Allied Properties could face a downgrade to B1/B2 (or accelerated multi-notch downgrade to B2/B3) if the following adverse developments occur:

1. **Distribution Cut Delayed Beyond Q1 2026:** Management postpones inevitable distribution adjustment, accelerating cash burn and weakening refinancing capacity; AFFO payout ratio remains >120% through mid-2026
2. **Asset Sale Execution Failure:** 150 West Georgia monetization postponed beyond Q2 2026 or achieves <$200M proceeds; total asset sales in 2026 <$300M, preventing meaningful deleveraging
3. **Further Asset Value Deterioration:** Fair value losses exceed $500M in 2025, driving debt/assets >85%; NAV per unit declines below $35, widening discount to market price
4. **Occupancy Decline Acceleration:** Leased occupancy falls below 85% with major tenant move-outs or bankruptcies; occupied space drops below 80%
5. **Covenant Breach or Waiver Requirement:** Debt/unencumbered assets approaches 60% covenant threshold requiring bank waiver or amendment; interest coverage falls below 1.75x triggering technical default
6. **Refinancing Failure or Prohibitive Pricing:** Unable to refinance 2026 maturities on acceptable terms; credit spreads exceed +350 bps indicating market loss of confidence; forced to issue secured debt or accept onerous covenant restrictions
7. **Liquidity Crisis Emergence:** Available liquidity falls below $500M without committed refinancing sources; cash burn accelerates beyond asset sale capacity
8. **EBITDA Deterioration:** Annualized adjusted EBITDA declines >10% from current $375M level due to NOI erosion or increased operating costs
9. **Distribution Cut Insufficient:** If distribution cut implemented but sized too small (<20% reduction), failing to restore sustainable coverage and delaying balance sheet repair
10. **Capital Markets Access Lost:** Equity becomes unissuable due to extreme dilution concerns; unsecured debt markets closed to Allied; reliant entirely on secured lending

**Specific Threshold Example:** If Allied maintains current distribution into Q2 2026 (AFFO payout remaining >150%), fails to execute 150 West Georgia sale by mid-2026, experiences occupancy decline to 84%, and faces 2026 refinancing at spreads >+300 bps with covenant restrictions, a downgrade to B1 (or B2 if multiple factors converge) would be warranted.

## 5-Factor Rating Scorecard

### Moody's REITs and Other Commercial Real Estate Firms Methodology

This analysis applies a 5-factor scorecard methodology consistent with Moody's, DBRS, and S&P rating frameworks for real estate companies.

### Scorecard Assessment

| **Factor** | **Weight** | **Assessment** | **Score** | **Rationale** |
|------------|------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **1. Scale & Diversification** | 15% | Ba2 | 2.5/5 | Gross assets of $10.4B and 9.5M SF urban workspace portfolio provides meaningful scale, but single-sector (office) and single-country (Canada) concentration limits diversification. Portfolio spans Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver providing geographic breadth within Canada. |
| **2. Asset Quality & Portfolio** | 20% | Ba3 | 2.0/5 | Urban office portfolio facing structural headwinds reflected in $394M fair value losses. Occupancy 87.4% leased (84.0% occupied) down from 87.2%/85.6% YoY. Average in-place rent $25.19/SF stable but renewal spreads minimal at +1.5%. Portfolio concentrated in Class I urban workspace vulnerable to hybrid work trends. |
| **3. Leverage & Coverage** | 25% | **B1** | **1.5/5** | **Critical weakness.** Debt/assets 83.6%, net debt 12.3x EBITDA (target <10x), NOI/interest coverage 2.44x all indicate elevated leverage with minimal cushion. $2.27B debt maturities 2026-2028 create significant refinancing risk. IFRS net loss of $315.8M reflects asset impairment. |
| **4. Financial Flexibility** | 25% | **B1** | **1.5/5** | **Severely constrained.** AFFO payout ratio 166.7% is unsustainable. Distribution cut probability 59.9% (High Risk) indicates imminent capital structure adjustment. Prior 52.4% distribution cut (Jan 2024) with only 38.6% recovery signals persistent stress. High market volatility (75/100 risk score) limits equity issuance capacity. 9.23% dilution from LP units adds complexity. |
| **5. Liquidity & Cash Flow** | 15% | Ba2 | 2.5/5 | $803M available liquidity ($903M with accordion) provides adequate near-term buffer. However, AFFO of $113M (9mo) insufficient to cover $173M distributions paid, resulting in cash burn. Pending 150 West Georgia loan monetization (H1 2026) critical to liquidity maintenance. Monthly burn rate monitored closely by model. |
| **Overall Weighted Score** | **100%** | **Ba3/B1** | **1.9/5** | **Scorecard indicates non-investment grade rating in Ba3/B1 range, reflecting elevated credit risk driven by unsustainable distribution coverage and high leverage. Significant downside risk absent successful execution of deleveraging strategy and distribution reset. Rating could deteriorate to B2/B3 or improve to Ba2 depending on management actions over next 6-12 months.** |

**Rating Rationale:**

The weighted scorecard yields an overall score of **1.9/5**, placing Allied Properties firmly in the **Ba3/B1** rating category (non-investment grade, speculative). The rating is heavily influenced by critical weaknesses in Leverage & Coverage (Factor 3) and Financial Flexibility (Factor 4), which together account for 50% of the total weight and both score at the B1 level (1.5/5).

The Ba3/B1 positioning reflects:
- **Immediate credit stress:** Unsustainable 166.7% AFFO payout ratio with high (59.9%) distribution cut probability
- **Elevated leverage:** 83.6% debt/assets and 12.3x net debt/EBITDA with limited deleveraging progress since 2024 distribution cut
- **Asset quality deterioration:** $394M fair value losses and 31.5% unit price decline indicate ongoing valuation pressure
- **Refinancing risk:** $2.27B debt maturing 2026-2028 requires successful execution in challenging office market
- **Constrained flexibility:** Market volatility (risk score 75/100) limits equity issuance capacity

Positive factors preventing a deeper B2/B3 rating include:
- **Meaningful scale:** $10.4B asset base provides depth and diversification within urban office sector
- **Adequate liquidity:** $803M available provides 12-18 month runway for strategic actions
- **Resilient occupancy:** 87.4% leased occupancy demonstrates continued tenant demand despite sector headwinds
- **Easing rate environment:** Bank of Canada cuts (-125 bps) support refinancing and potential valuation stabilization
- **Strategic optionality:** Asset sales pipeline (150 West Georgia, non-core dispositions) provides deleveraging pathway

The rating outlook is **Negative**, reflecting high probability that credit metrics deteriorate further before stabilizing, particularly if distribution cut is delayed or asset sales execute below expectations.

## Key Observations

**Distribution Cut Appears Imminent and Necessary**

Allied Properties' 166.7% AFFO payout ratio and 59.9% distribution cut probability signal that management faces an unavoidable strategic decision in the near term. The current monthly distribution of $0.1216 per unit ($1.4592 annualized) is mathematically unsustainable and diverts capital from essential debt reduction. A prudent distribution reset would target 75-85% of AFFO, implying a reduction to approximately $0.60-$0.69 per unit annually ($0.05-$0.058 monthly), representing a 55-60% cut from current levels. While such a reduction would be painful for income-focused investors, it would preserve approximately $86-97 million annually for debt repayment and position Allied for credit rating stability. Management's willingness to cut distributions in January 2024 demonstrates precedent for difficult but necessary capital allocation decisions. The market has already priced in elevated distribution risk (unit price down 31.5% from peak), suggesting that a well-communicated cut focused on balance sheet repair could be viewed neutrally or even positively.

**Deleveraging Required But Equity Issuance Not Viable at Current Price**

Allied must reduce absolute debt by approximately $1.5-2.0 billion over the next 24-36 months to achieve investment-grade leverage metrics (targeting 60-65% debt-to-assets). At the current depressed unit price of $15.26, equity issuance would create unacceptable dilution. This forces Allied into a multi-pronged deleveraging strategy: (1) immediate and substantial distribution cut to retain $85-95 million annually; (2) accelerated non-core asset sales of $300-500 million over the next 18 months, accepting modest discounts to book value; (3) negotiated debt paydowns at refinancing with amortization schedules; and (4) strict capital discipline with development spending limited to committed projects. The absence of a quick equity solution means deleveraging will be a multi-year process requiring sustained operational focus and disciplined capital allocation.

**Refinancing Risk Manageable in Easing Rate Environment**

While Allied faces continuous refinancing requirements given its $4.68 billion in mortgage debt, the aggressive easing cycle by the Bank of Canada (policy rate down 250 bps to 2.75%) creates a supportive environment. Allied's weighted average interest rate on mortgages likely ranges from 3.5-4.5%, and refinancings in the current environment should achieve comparable or slightly lower rates, depending on credit spread movements. The key risk is not interest rate levels but rather lender willingness to maintain loan-to-value ratios. If lenders require 60% LTV or lower (down from historical 70-75%), Allied will face principal shortfalls at refinancing that must be filled through asset sales or credit facility drawdowns. Close monitoring of refinancing terms and lender sentiment is essential, with particular attention to covenant packages and amortization requirements.

**Office Sector Fundamentals Remain Challenged But Premium Assets Stabilizing**

Allied's focus on premium urban workspace in Canada's largest markets provides relative insulation from the worst office sector dynamics. Class A urban office buildings in downtown Toronto and Montreal continue to attract tenants seeking high-quality space with transit access and urban amenities. However, the sector faces a multi-year adjustment with key risks including: persistently elevated vacancy (Allied's occupancy metrics not fully disclosed but likely in the 84-87% range based on peer comparisons); tenant downsizing at lease renewals; declining effective rents in competitive submarkets; and limited transaction liquidity. The positive scenario involves occupancy stabilization in 2025-2026 as return-to-office policies solidify and space-per-employee ratios stabilize at new norms. The negative scenario involves continued tenant shrinkage and rent declines, particularly if economic growth weakens.

**Management Action Urgency - Need to Cut Distribution Before Covenant Stress**

Allied's management must act decisively on distribution policy in Q4 2025 or Q1 2026, before the unsustainable payout burns through financial flexibility and approaches covenant thresholds. The Declaration of Trust covenant requiring debt-to-gross book value below 60% (or 65% with convertibles) currently provides cushion at 45.2% reported debt-to-GBV. However, continued fair value losses (possible given office market dynamics) combined with distribution-funded cash outflows will steadily erode this cushion. If Allied's property values decline another 5-7% while maintaining current distributions, the REIT could approach covenant concerns within 12-18 months. Proactive distribution reduction, combined with a transparent deleveraging plan and asset sale program, would demonstrate management credibility and preserve strategic optionality. Delaying action risks forced distribution cuts under distressed conditions, which would damage unitholder confidence and credit market access.

### Detailed Peer Analysis

**Allied vs. Dream Office REIT:**

Dream Office has pursued aggressive deleveraging following its own period of financial stress, reducing debt-to-assets from historical levels of 55-60% to a more conservative 40-45% range through substantial asset sales. Dream's AFFO payout ratio of 80-90% is sustainable, contrasting sharply with Allied's 166.7%. Dream has achieved this deleveraging by:
- Accepting significant asset sale discounts to book value (10-20% in some cases)
- Maintaining distribution discipline with payout ratios anchored to cash generation
- Concentrating portfolio in stronger Toronto and Ottawa markets

*Key Differentiator:* Dream acted earlier and more aggressively on deleveraging, accepting near-term pain (reduced distributions, asset sale losses) to preserve long-term stability. Allied delayed similar actions, allowing leverage and distribution unsustainability to persist.

*Rating Implication:* Dream's conservative balance sheet likely supports a rating 1-2 notches higher than Allied's, despite similar property type exposure.

**Allied vs. Slate Office REIT:**

Slate Office represents a closer peer to Allied's current financial position, with elevated leverage (60-65% debt-to-assets), refinancing challenges, and distribution sustainability concerns. Slate has faced lender covenant discussions and has pursued a "Portfolio Realignment Plan" involving asset sales and potential distribution reductions. Key similarities:
- Both face refinancing pressures with lenders requiring lower LTVs
- Both operate with unsustainable or stressed distribution policies
- Both have experienced property value declines requiring fair value write-downs

*Key Differentiator:* Slate has been more transparent about its challenges, publicly announcing portfolio realignment plans and engaging with unitholders about potential strategic alternatives. Allied has been less communicative about its deleveraging strategy.

*Rating Implication:* Allied and Slate likely occupy similar rating territory (Ba3/B1 range), with differentiation based on specific asset quality and lender relationship strength.

**Allied vs. Diversified REITs (H&R REIT):**

H&R REIT's diversification across office, retail, and residential properties provides significant credit advantages relative to office-pure plays:
- Residential properties (apartments, condos) provide stable cash flow with growth potential
- Retail properties (anchored centers) complement office exposure
- Balance sheet strength from diversified cash flows supports investment-grade metrics

*Rating Implication:* Diversified REITs like H&R trade at lower cap rates and maintain investment-grade credit metrics (BBB- to BBB range), multiple notches above Allied's likely Ba3/B1 positioning.

### Competitive Positioning Assessment

**Allied's Relative Strengths vs. Peers:**

1. **Geographic Concentration in Strong Markets:** Allied's heavy Toronto/Montreal weighting provides exposure to Canada's most economically dynamic markets with favorable immigration and employment trends. Dream and Slate have more exposure to weaker markets (Calgary, Edmonton, smaller cities).

2. **Premium Urban Workspace Positioning:** Allied's focus on heritage brick-and-beam buildings in urban neighborhoods creates differentiated product that commands rental premiums versus commodity suburban office (Slate's focus). This positioning supports tenant retention and pricing power in recovering markets.

3. **Fixed-Rate Debt Structure:** Allied's 99.98% fixed-rate debt insulates from interest rate volatility better than peers with higher floating-rate exposure. This provides predictable debt service costs during deleveraging.

4. **Data Centre Diversification:** Allied's exposure to data centre properties provides exposure to secular growth outside traditional office, a differentiator versus pure-play office peers.

**Allied's Relative Weaknesses vs. Peers:**

1. **Severely Elevated Leverage:** Allied's 83.6% debt-to-assets is materially higher than Dream (40-45%) and even Slate (60-65%), limiting financial flexibility and requiring aggressive deleveraging.

2. **Unsustainable Distribution Policy:** Allied's 166.7% AFFO payout is the highest among all office REIT peers, representing the most acute distribution sustainability challenge in the sector.

3. **Delayed Deleveraging Action:** Dream began aggressive deleveraging 18-24 months earlier than Allied, benefiting from better asset sale market conditions. Allied's delay means executing asset sales in a weaker market with less transaction liquidity.

4. **Larger Absolute Debt Quantum:** Allied's $8.67 billion debt represents a larger absolute amount to refinance and service compared to smaller peers, creating higher execution risk and lender concentration.

**Market Positioning and Rating Expectations:**

Based on the peer comparison, Allied Properties' credit rating likely falls in the **Ba3/B1 range** (Moody's equivalent), with the following rationale:

- **Ba3 Positioning (Base Case):** Reflects elevated but manageable leverage, sustainable NOI generation, and supportive refinancing environment. Assumes management acts decisively on distribution cut and executes asset sale program successfully.

- **B1 Risk (Downside):** If Allied delays distribution cut, experiences larger-than-expected fair value losses (additional 5-10%), or faces refinancing challenges with lenders requiring aggressive LTV reductions.

- **Ba2 Opportunity (Upside):** If Allied proactively cuts distribution, successfully sells $300-500M in assets at/near book value, and reduces debt-to-assets to 75-78% within 12 months, a one-notch upgrade would be possible.

**Peer Rating Summary:**

| **REIT** | **Estimated Rating** | **Rationale** |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| H&R REIT (Diversified) | BBB- / BBB | Diversification, strong balance sheet, sustainable distributions |
| Dream Office REIT | Ba1 / Ba2 | Conservative leverage post-deleveraging, sustainable distributions |
| Allied Properties | Ba3 / B1 | Elevated leverage, unsustainable distributions, but strong assets |
| Slate Office REIT | B1 / B2 | High leverage, covenant pressures, refinancing challenges |

**Strategic Takeaway:**

Allied occupies a middle position among stressed office REITs—more challenged than Dream (which acted earlier on deleveraging) but potentially stronger than Slate (which faces more acute lender pressures). Allied's credit trajectory over the next 12-18 months will be determined by:
1. Speed and magnitude of distribution cut
2. Success of asset sale program (pricing and execution)
3. Refinancing terms achieved with mortgage lenders
4. Stabilization of office sector fundamentals (occupancy, rents)

Aggressive and transparent action on items 1-2 would support maintaining Ba3 rating or even improving to Ba2. Delays or adverse developments on items 3-4 would pressure toward B1 territory.

## Profile

**Issuer:** Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust

**Reporting Date:** 2025-09-30

**Report Period:** Q3 2025 (Three months ended September 30, 2025)

### Company Background

**Legal Structure and Identity:**

Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX: AP.UN) is an unincorporated open-ended real estate investment trust governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. The REIT operates through a conventional structure where Allied Properties REIT holds interests in Canadian real estate assets and distributes substantially all of its taxable income to unitholders, qualifying for favorable tax treatment under Canadian income trust provisions.

**Exchange Listing and Trading:**

Allied's common units trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under ticker symbol "AP.UN." As of September 30, 2025:
- Basic units outstanding: 127,955,983
- Diluted units outstanding: 139,765,128 (including Exchangeable LP Units and stock options)
- Unit price (October 31, 2025): CAD $15.26
- Implied market capitalization: CAD $1.95 billion (basic units only)
- 52-week trading range: $14.28 - $22.27

Allied is a mid-cap REIT by Canadian standards, with an enterprise value of approximately $10.6 billion (market cap plus net debt).

**Asset Base and Scale:**

Allied owns and manages an investment property portfolio valued at $9.52 billion (at September 30, 2025 fair values), comprising:
- Investment properties in operation: $9,392 million
- Investment properties held for sale: $123 million
- Total gross assets: $10,379 million

The portfolio consists primarily of urban office properties concentrated in major Canadian cities. While specific property counts and gross leasable area (GLA) were not extracted in the available data, Allied is among Canada's larger office-focused REITs, with a portfolio that historically exceeded 14-16 million square feet of GLA.

**Geographic Footprint:**

Allied's portfolio is diversified across Canada's major urban markets, with concentrations in:

*Core Markets (Primary Holdings):*
- **Toronto, Ontario:** Allied's largest market, comprising downtown and midtown urban office properties, particularly in the King-Spadina, Liberty Village, and Downtown Core submarkets
- **Montreal, Quebec:** Substantial holdings in Montreal's central business district and urban neighborhoods, targeting technology and creative sector tenants

*Secondary Markets:*
- **Vancouver, British Columbia:** Selective holdings in Vancouver's urban core
- **Calgary, Alberta:** Exposure to Calgary's downtown office market, which faced significant challenges from energy sector downturns
- **Edmonton, Alberta:** More limited exposure to Edmonton's office market

The geographic distribution across multiple provinces provides diversification benefits, reducing exposure to single-market economic cycles. However, Allied's concentration in office properties creates sector-specific risk that cannot be fully mitigated through geographic diversification.

**Property Type Focus:**

Allied Properties has historically positioned itself as Canada's leading urban workspace REIT, focusing on:

*Primary Property Types:*
- **Class I (Urban Workspace):** Brick-and-beam heritage office buildings in downtown urban neighborhoods, converted to modern office space with exposed brick, high ceilings, and creative workspace aesthetics
- **Class A Office:** Modern office towers and mid-rise buildings in central business districts
- **Data Centre Properties:** Allied has developed or acquired data centre facilities, providing diversification and exposure to secular growth in cloud computing and data infrastructure

*Tenant Profile:*
Allied's properties historically attracted tenants from:
- Technology and software companies
- Professional services (legal, accounting, consulting)
- Creative industries (architecture, design, advertising)
- Media and telecommunications firms
- Government agencies

This tenant mix reflects Allied's strategic focus on knowledge-economy employers seeking high-quality urban workspace with transit access and urban amenities. The tenant profile generally provides credit quality and lease stability, though technology sector tenants can be sensitive to economic cycles and venture capital availability.

**Corporate History:**

While detailed founding history was not available in the extracted data, Allied Properties REIT has operated as a public real estate investment trust for approximately two decades, growing through strategic acquisitions, development projects, and value-add repositioning of urban office properties. The REIT's strategy historically focused on acquiring underutilized heritage buildings in emerging urban neighborhoods, renovating them into modern office space, and leasing to creative-economy tenants at premium rents.

**Management and Governance:**

Specific management biographies were not available in the extracted financial data. However, Allied's enhanced disclosure practices, including detailed FFO/AFFO reconciliations and transparent reporting of dilutive instruments and fair value adjustments, suggest a governance culture focused on investor transparency.

The REIT's distribution policy has been adjusted twice in recent history:
1. January 2024: 52.4% distribution cut in response to elevated leverage and office market challenges
2. Subsequent partial restoration: Recovery to approximately 38.6% of pre-cut levels

This pattern demonstrates management's willingness to make difficult capital allocation decisions, but also reveals a reactive rather than proactive approach to distribution sustainability. The current 166.7% AFFO payout ratio suggests another distribution reset is likely necessary in the near term.

### Business Strategy

Allied Properties' business strategy has evolved significantly in response to post-pandemic office sector dynamics and balance sheet pressures. Based on the financial metrics, operating patterns, and market positioning evident in the data, Allied is currently executing a **defensive deleveraging and portfolio optimization strategy** rather than the historical growth-oriented approach.

**Historical Strategy (Pre-2020): Growth Through Urban Workspace Acquisition**

Allied's business model historically centered on:
1. Identifying underutilized heritage buildings in gentrifying urban neighborhoods
2. Acquiring properties at below-replacement cost
3. Renovating/repositioning into modern office space with heritage character
4. Leasing to knowledge-economy tenants at premium rents (10-20% above commodity office)
5. Harvesting value through cash flow growth and asset sales

This strategy successfully grew Allied into one of Canada's leading office REITs, with expanding portfolios in Toronto, Montreal, and other major cities. The value creation thesis relied on gentrification trends, downtown office demand growth, and tenant willingness to pay premiums for unique, amenity-rich workspace.

**Current Strategy (2024-2025): Defensive Repositioning and Deleveraging**

The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shift to hybrid work models have fundamentally disrupted Allied's growth strategy. The current strategic focus is defensive in nature:

**1. Balance Sheet Repair Through Selective Asset Sales**

Allied disposed of $44.1 million in properties during the first nine months of 2025, representing strategic pruning of non-core or underperforming assets. This asset sale program appears focused on:
- Harvesting capital from stronger properties to reduce debt
- Exiting weaker markets (likely Calgary and Edmonton given those markets' challenges)
- Simplifying the portfolio to focus on core Toronto and Montreal holdings

The relatively modest disposition volume ($44M vs. a $9.5B portfolio) suggests Allied is being opportunistic rather than conducting distressed sales. However, the elevated leverage (83.6% debt-to-assets) and distribution sustainability challenges will likely necessitate accelerated asset sales of $300-500 million over the next 18 months.

**2. Capital Expenditure Discipline and Development Curtailment**

Allied invested $141.7 million in development capital expenditures during the nine-month period, representing continued investment in committed development projects. However, this level of spending appears to be declining from historical levels, indicating:
- Completion of previously committed developments
- Reduced new project starts given capital constraints
- Focus on stabilizing existing properties rather than growth

Sustaining capex, leasing costs, and tenant improvements totaled $41.2 million, reflecting the ongoing capital required to maintain occupancy in competitive urban office markets. This "maintenance" capital requirement constrains Allied's free cash flow and contributes to the unsustainable distribution policy.

**3. Distribution Policy Under Review (Imminent Cut Expected)**

Allied's 166.7% AFFO payout ratio is mathematically unsustainable and represents a strategic choice to maintain unitholder distributions despite inadequate cash generation. This approach has multiple explanations:

*Possible Rationale:*
- Management belief that office market challenges are temporary, and distribution cuts would damage long-term unit price
- Pressure from income-focused unitholders resisting additional distribution reductions
- Time-buying strategy while executing asset sales and refinancings

*Distribution Cut Probability:*
The distribution cut prediction model assigns a 59.9% probability of an imminent cut based on:
- Self-funding ratio inadequacy
- Monthly burn rate pressures (primary model driver per coefficient analysis)
- High existing distribution relative to cash flow

A strategic distribution cut to 75-85% of AFFO would reset the monthly distribution to $0.05-$0.058 per unit (approximately $0.60-$0.69 annually), representing a 55-60% reduction from current levels. The saved capital ($85-95 million annually) would accelerate debt reduction and restore financial flexibility.

**4. Refinancing Management in Easing Rate Environment**

Allied faces continuous mortgage refinancing requirements given its $4.68 billion in mortgage debt. The strategic approach appears focused on:
- Locking in fixed-rate debt (99.98% of debt is fixed-rate) to eliminate interest rate risk
- Extending weighted average debt maturity to reduce near-term pressure
- Negotiating covenant flexibility with lenders to accommodate temporary leverage elevation

The easing interest rate environment (Bank of Canada policy rate down 250 bps to 2.75%) provides a favorable backdrop for refinancing, reducing all-in borrowing costs. However, lenders' focus on lower loan-to-value ratios (60-65% vs. historical 70-75%) will require equity contributions or partial debt paydowns at refinancing.

**5. Occupancy Retention and Tenant Relationship Management**

While specific occupancy metrics were not fully disclosed in the available data, Allied's operating strategy must focus on:
- Retaining existing tenants through proactive lease renewal discussions
- Right-sizing tenant space requirements to accommodate hybrid work models
- Investing in building amenities (lobbies, fitness centers, collaboration spaces) to compete for tenants
- Potentially offering rental concessions or tenant improvement allowances to maintain occupancy

The $241.9 million in NOI generation (9-month period) suggests Allied has maintained reasonably stable occupancy despite sector headwinds, though same-property NOI growth is likely negative or flat.

**6. Portfolio Concentration in Core Markets**

Allied appears to be strategically concentrating its portfolio in Toronto and Montreal, where urban office fundamentals are strongest. These markets benefit from:
- Limited downtown development supply (constraining new competitive supply)
- Strong immigration-driven population growth supporting office demand
- Government and professional services employment providing tenant stability
- Transit-oriented locations commanding premium rents

The strategy accepts ongoing challenges in Calgary and Edmonton, where energy sector weakness and economic softness have pressured office occupancy and rents. Allied's asset sales likely target these weaker markets, harvesting capital to reinvest in or delever the core Toronto/Montreal portfolio.

**Strategic Challenges and Risks:**

Allied's current strategy faces significant execution risks:
- Asset sale program may not achieve book value in current market conditions
- Distribution cut, while necessary, will pressure unit price and investor confidence
- Office sector fundamentals may not stabilize until 2026-2027, prolonging recovery
- Refinancing terms may require more aggressive deleveraging than planned
- Competition from newer Class A+ office properties could pressure Allied's heritage buildings

**Strategic Positioning Going Forward:**

Allied's long-term strategy likely involves positioning as a smaller, more focused urban workspace REIT with:
- Portfolio concentrated in Toronto and Montreal (80-90% of NOI)
- Leverage reduced to 60-65% debt-to-assets (requiring $1.5-2.0B debt reduction)
- Distribution policy reset to sustainable 70-80% AFFO payout
- Selective development of value-add projects in core urban neighborhoods
- Data centre properties providing growth and diversification

The path to this end state requires 24-36 months of disciplined execution, with near-term pain (distribution cuts, asset sales) necessary to preserve long-term viability. Management's credibility will depend on transparent communication, proactive capital allocation, and delivering on deleveraging commitments.

#### 4.3 Burn Rate and Cash Runway Analysis

**Applicability:** Yes

**What is Burn Rate:**
Burn rate measures the forward-looking speed at which a REIT depletes cash reserves based on current run rate. This is a **liquidity stress test** assuming NO future access to capital markets. A REIT can have *positive AFCF* but still burn cash if free cash flow is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations (debt service + distributions).

**Formula:**
```
Mandatory Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (period amounts)
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period
```

**Note:** New financing is NOT subtracted - burn rate assumes no future capital raises.

**Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Reporting Period | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **AFCF (Period)** | 63,704 | Q3 2025 (Three months ended September 30, 2025) | Free cash flow |
| **Mandatory Obligations:** | | | |
| - Total Debt Service | 846,903 | Q3 2025 (Three months ended September 30, 2025) | Interest + Principal |
| - Total Distributions | 172,741 | Q3 2025 (Three months ended September 30, 2025) | Common + Preferred |
| **Total Obligations** | 1,019,644 | Q3 2025 (Three months ended September 30, 2025) | - |
| **Period Deficit/(Surplus)** | -955,940 | Q3 2025 (Three months ended September 30, 2025) | AFCF - Obligations |
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | -106,216 | Per month | 9-month period |

**Self-Funding Analysis:**
- **Self-Funding Ratio:** 0.06x (AFCF / Mandatory Obligations)
- **Interpretation:** High capital markets reliance
- **Capital Markets Reliance:** Requires $955,940 external financing (94% of obligations)

**Liquidity Position:**

| Liquidity Source | Amount (CAD 000s) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Cash and Cash Equivalents** | 63,208 | End of period |
| **Marketable Securities** | 0 | Liquid investments |
| **Less: Restricted Cash** | (0) | Not available for operations |
| **Available Cash** | 63,208 | Immediately available |
| **Undrawn Credit Facilities** | 739,717 | Remaining capacity |
| **Total Available Liquidity** | 802,925 | Cash + facilities |

**Cash Runway Analysis:**

| Scenario | Liquidity Base | Runway (Months) | Runway (Years) | Depletion Date | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash Only** | 63,208 | 0.6 | N/A | 2025-10-17 | CRITICAL |
| **Extended** (w/ facilities) | 802,925 | 7.6 | 0.6 | 2026-05-16 | CRITICAL |

**Runway Calculation:**
- **Cash Only:** Available Cash (63,208) ÷ Monthly Burn (106,216) = 0.6 months
- **Extended:** Total Liquidity (802,925) ÷ Monthly Burn (106,216) = 7.6 months

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Risk Level | Risk Score | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | CRITICAL | 4/4 | 🚨 Critical Risk - Immediate financing required (< 6 months) |

**Risk Thresholds:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (Score 4): < 6 months runway - Immediate financing required
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (Score 3): 6-12 months runway - Near-term capital raise needed
- ⚠️ **MODERATE** (Score 2): 12-24 months runway - Plan financing within 12 months
- ✓ **LOW** (Score 1): > 24 months runway - Adequate liquidity runway

**Warning Flags:**
None identified

**Recommendations:**
- Suspend or reduce distributions immediately
- Accelerate non-core asset sales
- Pursue emergency financing (bridge loan, equity raise)
- Defer all non-critical capital expenditures
- Engage restructuring advisors

**Sustainable Burn Rate Analysis:**

| Metric | Amount (CAD 000s) | Assessment |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Target Runway** | 24 months | Management target |
| **Sustainable Monthly Burn** | 2,634 | Maximum sustainable burn rate |
| **Actual Monthly Burn** | -106,216 | Current burn rate |
| **Excess/(Deficit) Burn** | 103,582 | Above sustainable - Overspending by $103,582/month |

**Burn Rate Interpretation:**
AFCF of $63,704 covers 6% of mandatory obligations ($1,019,644). Monthly cash deficit of $106,216 must be funded through capital markets or asset sales.

**Credit Implications:**
🚨 Critical - High dependence on capital markets and undrawn credit facilities

#### 4.4 Liquidity and Distribution Coverage Assessment (Detailed Analysis)

*This section expands on the summary coverage metrics presented in Section 2.5 (Distribution Coverage Ratios) and Section 2.7 (AFCF Analysis) with detailed calculation methodology, per-unit analysis, and credit implications.*

Based on available metrics, the issuer demonstrates moderate liquidity with 2.27x interest coverage. Detailed liquidity analysis requires review of debt maturity schedule and available credit facilities.

**Historical Distribution Pattern:**

This section provides context on distribution history, cuts, and recovery patterns to assess long-term sustainability.

*Current Distribution:*
- **Monthly distribution per unit:** N/A CAD
- **Annual distribution per unit:** N/A CAD
- **Current yield:** N/A%

*Distribution Cut History:*
- **Total cuts detected (10-year history):** N/A
- **Most recent cut date:** N/A
- **Most recent cut magnitude:** N/A%
- **Recovery status:** N/A
- **Current distribution vs pre-cut level:** N/A%

*Recovery Analysis:*

Recovery analysis unavailable

**Credit Implications:**
- **Distribution stability:** History of N/A cut(s) indicates N/A
- **Management credibility:** N/A
- **Sustainability outlook:** N/A

**Detailed Coverage Analysis:**

*Per-Unit Basis - Distribution Coverage Calculation:*

The per-unit coverage analysis shows how many times distributions are covered by operating and free cash flow on a per-unit basis:

- **ACFO per unit:** 2.2945 / **Distributions per unit:** 1.3500 = **1.70x coverage**
  - Interpretation: Every dollar of distributions is covered 1.70x times by sustainable operating cash flow
  - Credit Implication: Strong coverage

- **AFCF per unit:** 0.4968 / **Distributions per unit:** 1.3500 = **0.37x coverage**
  - Interpretation: Every dollar of distributions is covered 0.37 times by free cash flow after all investments
  - Credit Implication: Insufficient coverage

*Total-Level Coverage - YTD Metrics vs. Annualized Obligations:*

This analysis measures the REIT's ability to service all financing obligations from available cash flow:

- **Distribution Coverage (YTD):**
  - ACFO: 294,233 thousands / Total distributions: 172,741 thousands = **1.70x** (Strong coverage)
  - AFCF: 63,704 thousands / Total distributions: 172,741 thousands = **0.37x** (Insufficient coverage)

- **Debt Service Coverage (AFCF vs. Annualized):**
  - AFCF YTD: 63,704 thousands / Annualized debt service: 846,903 thousands = **0.08x**
  - Benchmark: >1.0x = Self-funding debt service from free cash flow
  - Assessment: Coverage of 0.08x indicates REIT's ability to service debt from operating cash flow

- **Self-Funding Capacity:**
  - Self-funding ratio: **0.06x** (AFCF / Total obligations)
  - Financing gap: **-955,940** CAD thousands
  - Assessment: Ratio indicates degree of capital markets reliance (>1.0x = self-funding, 0.5-1.0x = moderate reliance, <0.5x = high reliance)

*Residual Cash Flows After Distributions:*

- ACFO residual: **121,492** CAD thousands (operating cash flow remaining after distributions)
- AFCF residual: **-109,037** CAD thousands (free cash flow remaining after distributions and investments)

*Interest Coverage:*
- NOI/Interest coverage of 2.27x is at or above typical REIT minimum (2.0x)
- Benchmark: >2.0x = Strong, 1.5-2.0x = Adequate, 1.2-1.5x = Tight, <1.2x = Insufficient

**Credit Impact Summary:**

1. **Distribution Sustainability:** Unsustainable
2. **Financing Flexibility:** Self-funding ratio of 0.06x indicates degree of capital markets reliance
3. **Growth Capacity:** Residual AFCF of -109,037 thousands shows internal capital availability for growth investments

*For summary coverage ratios, see Section 2.5. For AFCF calculation methodology, see Section 2.7.*

## Appendix C: Calculation Methodologies

### Leverage Metrics

**Debt / Gross Assets:**
```
Debt / Gross Assets = Total Debt / Gross Book Value
Where:
  Total Debt = Mortgages (current + non-current) + Credit Facilities + Senior Unsecured Debentures
  Gross Book Value = Total Assets (with Moody's adjustments if applicable)
```

**Net Debt Ratio:**
```
Net Debt Ratio = (Total Debt - Cash) / Gross Book Value
```

### Coverage Metrics

**NOI / Interest Coverage:**
```
NOI / Interest Coverage = Net Operating Income / Interest Expense
```

**Annualized Interest:**
```
Annualized Interest = Quarterly Interest Expense × 4
```

**Total Debt Service:**
```
Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Where:
  Annualized Interest = Interest expense for the reporting period (annualized)
  Principal Repayments = Scheduled principal payments for the reporting period

Note: Period amounts should be consistent (e.g., all quarterly or all annual)
```

**NOI / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
NOI / Debt Service Coverage = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate debt service coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight debt service coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient debt service coverage
```

**EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
EBITDA / Debt Service Coverage = EBITDA / Total Debt Service

Where:
  EBITDA = NOI (for REITs, NOI approximates EBITDA)
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest + Principal Repayments

Note: For REITs, NOI/Debt Service and EBITDA/Debt Service are equivalent
```

**FFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
FFO / Debt Service Coverage = FFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.5x = Strong coverage
  ≥ 2.0x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.5x = Moderate coverage
  < 1.5x = Weak coverage
```

**AFFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFFO / Debt Service Coverage = AFFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 2.0x = Strong coverage (significant cushion after sustaining capex)
  ≥ 1.5x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.25x = Tight coverage
  < 1.25x = Insufficient coverage
```

**ACFO / Debt Service Coverage:**
```
ACFO / Debt Service Coverage = ACFO / Total Debt Service

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.5x = Strong coverage (cash flow based)
  ≥ 1.25x = Adequate coverage
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (cannot cover debt service from operating cash)
```

### REIT Metrics

**FFO (Funds From Operations):**
```
FFO = IFRS Net Income
    + Adjustments A-U per REALPAC White Paper (January 2022)

Key Adjustments:
  A. Unrealized fair value changes (investment properties)
  B. Depreciation of depreciable real estate
  C. Amortization of tenant allowances
  ... (21 total adjustments)
```

**AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations):**
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Sustaining Capital Expenditures (Adjustment V)
     - Leasing Costs (Adjustment W)
     - Tenant Improvements (Adjustment X)
     - Straight-Line Rent Adjustment (Adjustment Y)
     - Non-Controlling Interests (Adjustment Z)
```

**ACFO (Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations):**
```
ACFO = IFRS Cash Flow from Operations
     + Adjustments 1-17 per REALPAC ACFO White Paper (January 2023)

Key Adjustments:
  1. Change in working capital (non-sustainable)
  2. Interest expense in financing activities
  3. Joint venture distributions/ACFO
  4. Sustaining capital expenditures (MUST match AFFO)
  5. External leasing costs
  6. Sustaining tenant improvements (MUST match AFFO)
  7. Realized investment gains/losses
  8. Taxes (non-operating)
  9-10. Transaction costs (acquisitions/disposals)
  11. Deferred financing fees
  12. Debt termination costs
  13. Off-market debt adjustments
  14. Interest timing adjustments
  15. Puttable instruments distributions
  16. Right of Use (ROU) asset adjustments (IFRS 16)
  17. Non-controlling interests
```

**Critical Requirement:** CAPEX, tenant improvements, and leasing costs MUST be consistent between AFFO and ACFO calculations.

**FFO Payout Ratio:**
```
FFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / FFO per Unit) × 100
```

**AFFO Payout Ratio:**
```
AFFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / AFFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Payout Ratio:**
```
ACFO Payout Ratio = (Distributions per Unit / ACFO per Unit) × 100
```

**ACFO Coverage:**
```
ACFO Coverage = ACFO / Total Distributions
```

**AFCF (Adjusted Free Cash Flow):**
```
AFCF = ACFO + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Where:
  ACFO = Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (per REALPAC 2023)
  Net CFI = Cash Flow from Investing Activities (IFRS statement)
            Including: Development CAPEX, acquisitions/dispositions,
                      JV capital contributions/returns

IMPORTANT - Double-Counting Prevention:
  ACFO already deducts:
    - Sustaining CAPEX (Adjustment 4)
    - Sustaining TI (Adjustment 6)
    - External leasing costs (Adjustment 5)

  CFI should ONLY include:
    - Development/growth CAPEX (NOT sustaining)
    - Property acquisitions and dispositions
    - JV capital contributions/returns (NOT distributions)
    - Business combinations
```

**AFCF Per Unit:**
```
AFCF per Unit (Basic) = AFCF / Common Units Outstanding (weighted average)

AFCF per Unit (Diluted) = AFCF / Diluted Units Outstanding (weighted average)

Where:
  Diluted Units = Basic Units + Dilutive Instruments
  Dilutive Instruments = RSUs + DSUs + Options + Convertible Debt + Warrants
```

### AFCF Coverage Metrics

**AFCF Debt Service Coverage:**
```
AFCF Debt Service Coverage = AFCF / Total Debt Service

Where:
  Total Debt Service = Annualized Interest Expense + Principal Repayments

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (can cover debt service from free cash flow)
  < 1.0x = Reliant on capital markets for debt service
```

**AFCF Payout Ratio:**
```
AFCF Payout Ratio = (Total Distributions / AFCF) × 100

Assessment Thresholds:
  < 100% = Distributions sustainable from free cash flow
  ≥ 100% = Distributions exceed free cash flow
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Ratio:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Where:
  Total Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions (per reporting period)

Assessment Thresholds:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no capital markets reliance)
  0.8-1.0x = Low reliance on external financing
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate reliance on capital markets
  < 0.5x = High reliance on capital markets

Note: Does NOT subtract new financing - measures inherent cash generation capacity
```

**AFCF Self-Funding Capacity:**
```
AFCF Self-Funding Capacity = AFCF - (Total Debt Service + Total Distributions)

Interpretation:
  Positive = Surplus cash after all financing obligations
  Negative = Deficit requiring external financing
```

### Burn Rate and Cash Runway Metrics

**Burn Rate Applicability:**
```
Burn Rate applies when: AFCF < Total Financing Obligations

Where:
  Total Financing Obligations = Debt Service + Distributions

Note: A REIT can have positive AFCF but still burn cash if free cash flow
      is insufficient to cover mandatory obligations.
```

**Monthly Burn Rate:**
```
Period Deficit = AFCF - Mandatory Obligations (when AFCF < Obligations)
Monthly Burn Rate = Period Deficit / Number of Months in Period

Where:
  Mandatory Obligations = Total Debt Service + Total Distributions
  New financing is NOT subtracted (assumes no future capital raises)
```

**Self-Funding Ratio (Burn Rate Context):**
```
Self-Funding Ratio = AFCF / Mandatory Obligations

Interpretation:
  ≥ 1.0x = Self-funding (no burn rate - generates surplus)
  0.8-1.0x = Low burn rate (nearly self-funding)
  0.5-0.8x = Moderate burn rate (moderate capital markets reliance)
  < 0.5x = High burn rate (high capital markets reliance)
```

**Cash Runway:**
```
Available Cash = Cash + Marketable Securities - Restricted Cash

Cash Runway (months) = Available Cash / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Extended Runway = (Available Cash + Undrawn Facilities) / |Monthly Burn Rate|

Where:
  Undrawn Facilities = Remaining credit facility capacity
  |Monthly Burn Rate| = Absolute value of monthly burn rate
```

**Liquidity Risk Assessment:**
```
Risk Level based on Cash Runway:
  < 6 months    = CRITICAL (Score 4) - Immediate financing required
  6-12 months   = HIGH (Score 3) - Near-term capital raise needed
  12-24 months  = MODERATE (Score 2) - Plan financing within 12 months
  > 24 months   = LOW (Score 1) - Adequate liquidity runway
```

**Sustainable Burn Rate:**
```
Target Runway = 24 months (default)
Sustainable Monthly Burn = Available Cash / Target Runway

Excess Burn = Actual Monthly Burn - Sustainable Monthly Burn

Status:
  Excess Burn < 0 = Below sustainable (cash cushion)
  Excess Burn > 0 = Above sustainable (corrective action needed)
```

### Coverage Quality Assessment

**Distribution Coverage Assessment:**
```
Coverage Quality (applies to FFO/AFFO/ACFO/AFCF coverage):

  ≥ 1.3x = Strong coverage (30%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.1x = Adequate coverage (10%+ cushion)
  ≥ 1.0x = Tight coverage (< 10% cushion)
  < 1.0x = Insufficient coverage (distributions exceed metric)
```

**Payout Ratio Assessment:**
```
Payout Ratio Quality (inverse of coverage):

  ≤ 77% = Strong (< 77% payout = 1.3x+ coverage)
  ≤ 91% = Adequate (< 91% payout = 1.1x+ coverage)
  < 100% = Tight (< 100% payout = 1.0x+ coverage)
  ≥ 100% = Insufficient (payout exceeds metric)
```
